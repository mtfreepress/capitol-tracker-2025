    "text": "The 2025 Legislature is Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte's third session and the first since his re-election in 2024.\n\nThe governor appoints state agency heads and is ultimately responsible for the day-to-day management of government. The governor also prepares a budget proposal that serves as a starting point for the legislative appropriations process, where lawmakers determine how much the governorâ€™s executive branch is allowed to spend.\n\nBills passed by the Legislature are sent to the governor, who can sign them into law, issue a veto, or let them become law without his signature. Vetos can be overridden by two-thirds majority votes in both the House and Senate.",
