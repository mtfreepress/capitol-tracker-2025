summaryNarrative: |
  Hamm, 51 as of Election Day, is a Helena resident who has worked in internet technology and who has organized Montana’s statewide LGBTQ Pride celebration. He says he was raised in Helena, lived elsewhere as an adult, and returned to his hometown in 2008.

  Hamm previously made an unsuccessful bid for a seat on the Montana Public Service Commission, the state’s utility regulation board, in 2022.

  As he campaigns this year, Hamm says he felt like he needed to step up and run for office in order to stand up to “greedy extremists” who have made “vitriol and hate” a normal part of political discourse.

  “The direction of the country is out of line with the goals of the citizenry,” he said.

  This biography is based on written materials submitted by Hamm as well as past MTFP reporting.
