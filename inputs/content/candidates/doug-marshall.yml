summaryNarrative: |
  Doug Marshall is a longtime trial attorney with his own firm who says that Montana government — and the courts along with it — has been captured by corporate and partisan interests on both sides of the aisle. 

  A University of Montana law school graduate who grew up in Carbon County, Marshall says he believes the court should use its power to “protect the interests of those who are not currently in the political majority of the day.”

  “Montana’s Supreme Court needs to become and stay free of outside and inside partisan politics and veiled efforts to further increase the wealth disparity between common Montanans and those that have, in some form or another, aligned themselves with the economic and social elites from both coasts and the oil country of the West and Southwest,” he said on his campaign website. 

  Marshall didn’t respond to MTFP’s spring 2024 candidate questionnaire. This biography is based on materials on [Marshall’s campaign website](https://www.marshallforchief.com/judicial-philosophy).
