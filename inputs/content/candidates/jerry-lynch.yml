summaryNarrative: |
  Jerry Lynch, 73 as of Election Day, is a former federal magistrate judge vying to replace the retiring Chief Justice Mike McGrath on the Montana Supreme Court. 

  A Butte native from a politically involved family, Lynch says he’s running for the high court to maintain the court’s non-partisanship and independence. But he’s also been open about what he considers the political stakes of the election as Montana’s judicial branch and Republican officials increasingly find themselves at odds on their interpretation of the constitution as it pertains to issues like abortion.

  “Montanans of all political stripes face assaults on their constitutional rights and attempts by partisan extremists and out-of-state corporate interests to wrest control of government from the hands of the people,” Lynch told MTFP. “The Montana Constitution is a living document that derives its power from the consent of the governed. If we ignore it, or demean it, or allow it to be chipped away by whatever political party is currently in the majority, we will have only ourselves to blame when our government ceases to function.”

  Lynch also told MTFP his legal philsophy is simply to issue rulings based on the facts of the case and existing law and precedent. 

  “In my opinion, a good justice is someone who can write an opinion that may upset his friends and earn the respect of his opponents because that is what the facts and the law require,” he said.

  This biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by Lynch as well as prior MTFP reporting.
