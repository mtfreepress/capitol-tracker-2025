summaryNarrative: |
  Olson is the Daniels County attorney and a lawyer with the O’Toole Law Firm of Plentywood and Scobey.

  A 2020 University of Montana law school graduate and a member of the board of trustees for Scobey Public Schools, Olson has a history with a number of conservative legal causes, including as a university chapter president of the Federalist Society. 

  Olson doesn’t appear to be actively running a campaign against Knudsen. He has no campaign website, has reported no fundraising, and the individual his campaign hired for campaign finance compliance work is the same as Knudsen’s. 

  Olson did not respond to MTFP’s candidate questionnaire. This biography is based on Olson’s LinkedIn page.
