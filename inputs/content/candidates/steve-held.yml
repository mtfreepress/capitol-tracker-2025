summaryNarrative: |
  Held, 64 as of Election Day, describes himself as a fourth-generation Powder County rancher and businessman. He says he was raised near Broadus and worked in New York and California before returning to Montana to raise his family in 2005.

  Held is the father of one of the plaintiffs in Montana’s [high-profile youth climate litigation](https://montanafreepress.org/held-v-montana-climate-trial/).

  As he campaigns, he says he wants to advocate for a Farm Bill that effectively supports family farms

  “The vast majority of Montanans agree we need to take our state and country back,” Held said, “and I’m the only candidate ready and willing to take on the special interests, lobbyists, and corruption to deliver results for workers, the middle-class, Native Americans, seniors, and families.

  This biography is based on written materials submitted to MTFP by Held, verified where possible against public records.
