  Welborn, 55 as of Election Day, is a termed-out state lawmaker from Dillon. In addition to chairing the Senate Natural Resources Committee, Welborn serves on the Finance and Claims Committee and Highways and Transportation Committee.

  Welborn also ranches and owns a trailer dealership. He  said he is running for the PSC to give voice to the interests and concerns of small business owners and rural communities. Working in the private sector has shown him the importance of being a responsive problem-solver, and he’d like to bring “common sense” to Helena, he said.

  Welborn said Montana’s long-term energy security requires that the PSC maintain a business-friendly environment for energy investment. He argues that it is important for the commission to balance energy reliability with affordability for utility customers. 

  Welborn also said he aims to protect power consumers from “unfair rate increases” and encourage greater constituent participation in the matters that come before the PSC. 

  “I understand the role of the commission work and the challenges facing Montana energy producers,” Welborn told MTFP.

  This biography is based on Welborn’s response to MTFP’s questionnaire and information from the Montana Legislature’s lawmaker roster.
