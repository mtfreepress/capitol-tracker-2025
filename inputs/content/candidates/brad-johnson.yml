summaryNarrative: |
  Brad Johnson, 73 as of Election Day, is a former Montana secretary of state and Public Service Commission chairman. 

  “I believe that the future of this Republic is in greater peril today than at any time since the civil war, and I want to play an active role in forging the solutions to the challenges the country faces,” Johnson said.

  Johnson wants to actively oppose the policies of the Biden Administration or actively support the policies of the would-be Trump Administration. He says he believes in reducing federal spending, reinstating the Trump-era “remain in Mexico” policy and opposing government efforts at combating climate change. 

  He’s positioned himself as a grassroots alternative to Sheehy and has accused national Republicans of attempting to manufacture the outcome of the primary following Congressman Matt Rosendale’s termination of his campaign. 

  As former secretary of state and chairman of the Public Service Commission, I have proven electability and a real record for Montanans to judge,” Johnson wrote in [a recent opinion column](https://missoulian.com/opinion/column/brad-johnson-election-interference-is-on-full-display-in-montana/article_a428de2e-d7fe-11ee-a5bf-2bc5ea1b1a77.html). “Mr. Sheehy has neither. Mitch McConnell and Steve Daines need to get their thumbs off the scale and let Montana Republicans choose their Senate candidate without further outside interference from The Swamp.”

  This biography is based on material Johnson provided to MTFP as well as prior MTFP coverage of his campaign.
