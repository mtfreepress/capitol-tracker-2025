  Driscoll, 78 as of Election Day, is a Helena resident who has previously served as a state legislator, public service commissioner and Montana National Guard officer. He was also serving in the Pentagon when the building was hit by a plane during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, according to an [account he gave to the Helena Independent Record](https://helenair.com/news/local/get-out-of-the-building-john-driscoll-recalls-day-that-changed-the-world/article_275b14e7-c2db-5d9c-bc00-cb1b9a5c3d86.html) in 2021. He says he was born in Los Angeles but has maintained Montana residency since his parents moved him to Butte as a 3-year-old. 

  Driscoll, who has run for office in the past as both a Democrat and as a Republican, has cited a variety of issues including climate change and nuclear arms control as he explains his decision to run for Congress this year.

  “I care enough about our country to ensure our U.S. House of Representatives maintains our constitutional democracy,” he said in a written statement to MTFP.

  This biography is based on an interview and written material provided to MTFP by Driscoll, verified against past newspaper accounts and public records where possible.
