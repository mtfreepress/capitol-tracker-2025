summaryNarrative: |
  Katherine Bidegaray, 64 as of Election Day, is a state district court judge in eastern Montana running to replace the retiring Justice Dirk Sandefur on the Montana Supreme Court. 

  Born in Sidney to Basque immigrants, she touts her experience as a young lawyer fighting to save her family’s ranch following her father’s death as a foundational moment in her legal career.

  “My legal philosophy centers on fairness, respect, and impartiality,” she told MTFP. “It is rooted in a firm commitment to the rule of law. I approach each case with an open mind, basing decisions on the facts and applicable legal principles presented, rather than on personal beliefs or external pressures.”

  She warned that the rights guaranteed in the Montana Constitution — privacy, a clean and healthful environment and so on — are under threat, making it crucial to have “justices with the integrity, fortitude, and commitment to uphold our Constitution, to protect and defend our Montana values and rights, and to keep the judiciary fair and impartial.”

  This biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by Bidegaray as well as prior MTFP reporting.
