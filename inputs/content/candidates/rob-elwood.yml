summaryNarrative: |
  Elwood, 64 as of Election Day, is a member of the Harlowton City Council who ran unsuccessfully for the Public Service Commission in 2020 as an independent. He describes himself as a veteran and a “regular Montanan” who understands how commissioners’ work affects the day-to-day lives of the people they serve. 

  “I'm not a lawyer, and I'm not a legislator up against term limits. I live and work here and understand the impact of rate hikes, telecommunications quality and availability,” he said.

  Elwood told MTFP he considers limited access to cell phone coverage and internet in parts of eastern Montana a “travesty” he would like to fix. He also said he is passionate about railroad safety. He said his remote work with health care provider Altera as an interface analyst has familiarized him with the sort of specialized, complex work he would enjoy doing as a commissioner. He added that serving if elected, serving on the PSC would be his full-time job.

  “I'm environmentally conscious, as are most people who live and work around the agricultural industry, but I approach it from a reasonable point of view,” Elwood said. 

  This biography is based on an MTFP interview with Elwood and his response to an MTFP questionnaire.
