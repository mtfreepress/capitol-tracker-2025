summaryNarrative: |
  Swanson, 47 as of Election Day, is the current Broadwater County attorney, a self-described “tough on crime” prosecutor who has never before held judicial office. 

  He says his array of experience as an attorney and prosecutor, as well as his time in the Army National Guard makes him not only qualified for the chief justiceship but also gives him a unique perspective.

  Swanson, who [has a history in Republican politics](https://helenair.com/cory-swanson-attorney-for-republican-governor-candidate-rick-hills-campaign/image_86a03650-220b-11e2-b88a-0019bb2963f4.html) and working under GOP state officials, acknowledges that he’s a conservative, but says he’s devoted to the court’s independence and non-partisanship.

  “I'm dedicated to preserving the independence of the judiciary, but also focusing on the needs of lawyers, courts, and especially clients to identify those areas where we need the system to function better,” Swanson told MTFP.

  That said, he also shares the view that many Republicans espouse that the court has departed from strict constitutional interpretation.

  “My mindset has been entirely deferential to judges and to the courts,” he said. “But my plan changed in the past year because the Supreme Court has been deciding too many cases in a way that departs from sound appellate judge practice. It undermines the reliability of the law, and I felt I could do better.”
