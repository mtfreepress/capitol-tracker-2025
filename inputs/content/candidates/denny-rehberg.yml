  Rehberg, 68, is a Billings businessman and onetime Montana political fixture who is making a bid to return to office this year after spending more than a decade largely out of the state’s political spotlight.

  Rehberg previously represented Montana in the U.S. House from 2001 to 2013, leaving office after making a failed bid for U.S. Senate against Democrat Jon Tester in 2012. He also served as lieutenant governor under Republicans Stan Stephens and Marc Racicot. Over the course of his business career, he has worked as a cashmere goat rancher, operated fast food restaurant franchises and developed real estate. He has also served as co-chairman of Washington, D.C. public affairs firm Mercury.

  In interviews and public statements, Rehberg has touted his experience in Congress and cast himself as a known quantity for eastern district voters.

  “I know how to make my way around. And really what you do in Congress is you build coalitions of like-minded people,” he told Montana Talks host Aaron Flint in February 2024.

  Rehberg and two of his staffers were injured in [a high-profile Flathead Lake boat crash](https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-congress/2012/10/report-on-rehberg-boat-crash-released-147927) in 2009. The boat’s driver, a state senator, later pleaded no contest to a felony criminal endangerment charge.

  Rehberg declined to participate in MTFP’s spring 2024 candidate questionnaire. This biography is based on [prior MTFP reporting](https://montanafreepress.org/2024/02/21/denny-rehberg-vying-return-to-congress/) and a profile published this year [by the Billings Gazette](https://billingsgazette.com/news/state-regional/denny-rehberg-congress-house-rosendale/article_085aff14-d0dc-11ee-9d1c-2bdc88383dcd.html).
