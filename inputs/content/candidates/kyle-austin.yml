  Austin, 42 as of Election Day, owns Billings pharmacy Pharm406. He says he grew up on a farm west of Havre, was educated at the University of Montana and has practiced pharmacy in the state for 15 years.

  Austin previously made an unsuccessful bid for Congress in 2022, failing to advance beyond the eastern district Republican primary.

  He says his campaign this year is focused on restoring integrity to government.

  “I am running for this office to get our government back on track, rebuild trust, earn respect, restore honor and unite our government so we can once again get back to business,” he said.

  This biography is based on material Austin provided to MTFP as well as [prior MTFP coverage](https://montanafreepress.org/2022/05/24/matt-rosendale-challengers-montana-eastern-us-house/) of his 2022 campaign.
