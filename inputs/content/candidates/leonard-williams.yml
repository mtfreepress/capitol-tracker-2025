summaryLine: Butte electrician and labor organizer
summaryNarrative: |
  Williams is a Butte resident who is serving as the president of the Southwest Montana Central Labor Council. 

  A former board member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers who has worked on electrical projects all around Montana, Williams told MTFP that he is passionate about organizing workers, serving on political campaigns and volunteering in his community.

  Williams said he was partially inspired to run for the commission because he’s troubled by its decision last year to [authorize a double-digit increase](https://montanafreepress.org/2023/10/25/public-service-commission-approves-northwestern-energy-rate-hike/) for NorthWestern Energy’s residential electricity customers. 

  “Maybe they should be thinking about a little more green energy as opposed to trying to sell it out of state and we get stuck with the expensive electricity here,” he told MTFP. 

  An electrician by trade, Williams said he has a “pretty good feel for how energy is transported,” having completed work on hydroelectric dam, substation, natural gas compression station and wind farm projects.

  Williams didn’t respond to MTFP’s spring 2024 candidate questionnaire. This biography is based on information from an MTFP interview with Williams.
