  Bushman, 58 as of Election Day, is a Billings resident who served on the commission from 2013 to 2016 and narrowly lost a second bid for a PSC seat in 2020.

  Bushman is a mechanical engineer who said he’s helped some of the state’s largest producers and consumers of energy meet regulatory and production challenges. Bushman formerly worked for Sibanye-Stillwater, the South Africa-based owner of the Stillwater and East Boulder platinum and palladium mines in southern Montana. 

  Bushman said he’s running for another term on the PSC because he was asked to by people concerned about the commission and because he’d like to encourage better decision-making in government for the sake of his four children.

  Bushman told MTFP that he would like to ensure that there is a “fair playing field” between renewable power generators and the utilities buying power from them. He said the commission is tasked with applying regulations laid out in state and federal laws, not writing regulations, and there is no place for considering climate change in the commission’s work.

  “I will push back on the agendas of the environmentalists using federal policy to push costly technology that doesn’t solve the challenges of today,” he said. 

  This biography is based on an MTFP interview with Bushman, Bushman’s response to MTFP’s questionnaire and election information from Ballotpedia.
