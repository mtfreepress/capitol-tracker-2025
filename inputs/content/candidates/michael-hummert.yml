summaryNarrative: |
  Hummert, 65, is a U.S. Navy veteran and Helena resident who cites Bill Clinton’s 1996 State of the Union Speech as the best summary of his political perspective. He also cites a hardscrabble childhood and diverse work experience including stints as a salvage diver, school bus driver, Montana Highway patrolman and running a home remodeling business.

  He describes himself as a pragmatic Democrat who wouldn’t be afraid to buck his party and isn’t “afraid to ask the hard questions.”

  Hummert said he grew up in southern Illinois and moved to Helena in 1996 after retiring from the Navy.

  “Our county’s leadership is consumed by their self-interest, party loyalty, and we have no one to represent the people,” he told MTFP, “that is my mission.”

  This biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by Hummert’s campaign via interviews and a written questionnaire.
