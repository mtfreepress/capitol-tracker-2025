  Speaker of the House [Brandon Ler, R-Savage](/capitol-tracker-2025/lawmakers/Brandon-Ler/), said in [an August statement](/capitol-tracker-2025/additional-docs/SB-437-statement.pdf) that he was holding SB 437 instead of transmitting it to the governor so it could be signed into law in order to keep it from being tied up in ongoing litigation over a similar measure from 2023.
