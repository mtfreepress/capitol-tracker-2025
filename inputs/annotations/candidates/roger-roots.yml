summaryNarrative: |
  Roger Roots, 57 as of Election Day, is a Libertarian attorney who’s run for a number of Montana offices since 2012.

  More recently, he’s known for his legal assistance to Jan. 6 defendants, [the Bundy family](https://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-standoff/2016/08/montana_man_roger_roots_to_ser.html) and Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes.  

  “Presently the Supreme Court is extremely biased in favor of promoting intrusive expansive government,” he told MTFP. “I hope to perform clerical duties while always looking out for the freedoms of Montanans.”

  Roots has two felony convictions — one of which was for possessing firearms as a felon — and was dismissed from a position with the Conrad Burns campaign in the 1990s because of his associations with known white supremacists.

  He’s since [publicly disavowed](http://www.choteauacantha.com/news/article_50ddd612-4f6d-11e4-a362-877ecfd9068c.html) his racist past, and now says he’s running because “government at every level is out of control and I hope to protect Montanans' individual freedoms.”

  This biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by Roots and [past media reports](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/14/oath-keepers-jan-6-trial-stewart-rhodes-roger-roots-00056707).
