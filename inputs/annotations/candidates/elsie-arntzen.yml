summaryNarrative: |
  Arntzen, 68 as of Election Day, has served as Montana’s top elected public education official for the past eight years. A former teacher, she was born in Billings and represented Billings-area seats in the state Legislature from 2005 to 2017.

  As Arntzen campaigns this year, she describes herself as a staunch “America First” conservative who will stand up for families and Montana values in Congress.

  “America is fed up, and we cannot continue to saddle our children and grandchildren with the problems we need to tackle today,” she said.

  Arntzen [was cited in May 2022](https://montanafreepress.org/2022/05/27/helena-police-plan-to-issue-arntzen-citation-for-stop-arm-violation/) for an incident where she allegedly drove past a school bus with its stop lights deployed, ultimately paying a $135 fine.

  This biography is based on written materials submitted by Arntzen’s campaign, as well as MTFP reporting.
