summaryNarrative: |
  Jerry O’Neil, 81 as of Election Day, is a former Republican state lawmaker from Columbia Falls who says his first legal experience came representing himself pro se in a child custody case. 

  He began his career as an paralegal in the 1980s, when he says he became permitted to practice law before the Blackfeet tribal court. 

  He has never passed the Montana bar examination but he has passed the Blackfeet tribal court bar, according to court records. He has been engaged in several [years-long fights](https://whitefishpilot.com/news/2012/sep/12/paralegal-says-he-won-his-war-9/) about his ability to practice law in Montana. 

  “I am running for the justice position on the Montana Supreme Court in order to break the monopoly of the Montana State Bar Association, improve the public's access to our justice system, and expose the court when they legislate from the bench,” he told MTFP. 

  This biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by O’Neil as well as prior MTFP reporting.
