summaryNarrative: |
  Todd, 68 as of Election Day, is a Kalispell business owner and a pastor at Purpose Church Kalispell. She was born in Pomona, California, and says she has lived in Kalispell full time since 2009. She says she and her husband, a retired U.S. Navy aviator, have four sons.

  Todd [became a public figure](https://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/life/my-montana/2014/11/09/murder-international-coverup-alleged-new-book/18667763/) after the death of her son Shane, who Todd says was murdered in Singapore in 2012. She previously made an unsuccessful bid for Congress in 2022, failing to advance beyond that year’s western district Republican primary.

  She cites border control as the nation’s most significant issue and also says she wants to fight alleged corruption.

  “I'm running to end government corruption, which I have seen at the deepest level after the federal government covered up my son's murder when he refused to compromise the illegal transfer of technology to the CCP,” she said in a statement to MTFP.

  This biography is based on Todd’s response to a MTFP candidate questionnaire and prior media reports, including coverage of her 2022 campaign.
