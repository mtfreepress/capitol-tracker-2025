summaryNarrative: |
  Hunt, 71 as of Election Day, is a Helena attorney in private practice and a retired Montana National Guard lieutenant colonel. He and his law partner, Pat Fox, represent people with personal injury claims and insurance disputes. 

  Hunt was born in Missoula, raised in Chester and has lived in Helena since the 1980s. His wife and two daughters work in the mental health and social work fields, a fact Hunt says has influenced his understanding of society. Hunt says he is running for governor as a Democrat to pursue a more fair and equitable state.

  “The governor turned down $15,000,000 for hungry children, had a $2.5-billion budget surplus and still raised state property taxes on Montana homeowners,” Hunt told MTFP. 

  Hunt graduated from the University of Montana School of Law in 1982. After his father, Bill Hunt, was elected to the Montana Supreme Court, Hunt took over his father’s law practice. He previously ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, losing in the 2008 Democratic primary. 

  This biography is based on Hunt’s professional website and responses to MTFP.
