  Bilo, 62 as of Election Day, is a former energy specialist with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory who teaches courses related to energy-efficient and renewable energy technologies at Gallatin College in Bozeman.

  Bilo said she is committed to using the technologies she explains to the students enrolled in the workforce training courses she teaches.

  “I walk my talk,” she said. “My home is energy- and water-efficient and is powered by a 3.6-kilowatt solar electric/photovoltaic system that produces all the electricity for home and my electric vehicle. I use the system to educate and inform my students, neighbors and participants of the American Solar Energy Society’s Tour of Solar Homes.”

  Bilo said she is running “because Montana’s hard-working citizens deserve better representation on the PSC.” 

  The commission can address climate change and the harmful effects of pollution generated by fossil fuel energy sources by giving renewable energy projects “fair and due consideration,” Bilo said. If elected, Bilo said she would use her knowledge of both the electricity grid and efficiency measures on “both sides of the meter” to help the commission bring down regulated utility customers’ rates. 

  This biography is based on an MTFP interview with Bilo and Bilo’s response to MTFP’s questionnaire.
