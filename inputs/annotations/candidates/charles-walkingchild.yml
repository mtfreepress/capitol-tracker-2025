summaryNarrative: |
  Walking Child, an Anishinaabe tribal member with Blackfeet heritage, describes himself as a “poor man’s Republican” who wants to wrest Washington from corporate control and restore the U.S. to its basic constitutional principles. 

  Walking Child lives in Helena and owns an environmental contracting business.

  “I will fight for all veterans, small businesses, small farmers and ranchers, and not to forget ALL Montanans!” he wrote in a recent Facebook post. 

  Walking Child ran in the Republican primary for Montana’s eastern U.S. House district in 2022, coming in third in a field of four candidates. 

  Walking Child did not respond to MTFP’s spring 2024 candidate questionnaire. This biography is based on prior MTFP reporting and social media posts by the candidate.
