summaryNarrative: |
  Holden, 63 as of Election Day, is a Glendive-area rancher who previously spent eight years serving as a state senator. He says he was born in Spokane, Washington, and has lived in Montana since moving to the state as an infant. 

  As he campaigns, Holden has cited his desire to strengthen border security and advocate for agricultural interests in Washington, D.C.

  “I want to see the crazy border crisis ended and I believe that Montana needs someone in Washington, D.C., that is in agriculture watching out for them every day in committee,” he said.

  This biography is based on written materials provided to MTFP by Holden, verified against public records where possible.
