summaryNarrative: |
  Ellsworth is the current president of the Montana Senate, a position he’s held since 2023. 

  He says on his campaign website that he wants to help bring accountability to the state Supreme Court. Earlier this year, Ellsworth announced the formation of a special legislative committee to probe what he and other Republicans have labeled overreach by the judiciary following a series of adverse rulings.

  “Ellsworth believes there’s much to be done within the Montana Supreme Court,” his campaign website reads. “By restoring coequal power among the branches of government, improving oversight, and addressing constitutional cases, he aims to strengthen the judiciary.”

  Ellsworth is entering the second half of his four-year Senate term, so even if he loses the GOP Supreme Court clerk primary, he’ll remain in the Senate. 

  Ellsworth has his own personal history with the legal system: In 2021, [he pled guilty](https://montanafreepress.org/2021/08/02/jason-ellsworth-pleads-guilty-obstructing-officer/) to obstructing a peace officer during a traffic stop in a case prosecuted by current state Supreme Court candidate Cory Swanson, the Broadwater County attorney. And in 2009, he was ordered to pay a six-figure fine as part of a Federal Trade Commission judgment [related to his telemarketing company](https://ravallirepublic.com/news/local/ellsworth-gop-candidate-in-senate-dist-43-primary-explains-ftc-case-that-cost-him-600/article_5fa4543f-b659-5a97-9b82-25bdcb06c3f4.html). 

  Ellsworth didn’t respond to MTFP’s spring 2024 candidate questionnaire. This biography is based on Ellsworth’s campaign website and past MTFP reporting.
