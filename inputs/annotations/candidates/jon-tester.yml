  Tester, 68 as of Election Day, is seeking a fourth term in 2024.

  A self-described “three-fingered dirt farmer” who still works the family land outside of Big Sandy, Tester positions himself as a champion of rural America and multigenerational “Montana values.”

  But he’s also a shrewd politician and capable fundraiser who has repeatedly defied the odds in otherwise Republican-leaning Montana. Now, he’s the influential chair of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.

  “Montana needs somebody back in Washington, D.C., who understands rural America. Someone who fights for our freedoms and goes to bat for our veterans, our family farms and ranches, our working families, our health care workers and our teachers,” Tester said.

  Tester positions himself as a moderate willing to work with or oppose either Trump or Biden depending on the issue, though Republican critics note he still votes with the Democratic president the overwhelming majority of the time ([though less often than most other Democrats](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/jon-tester/)).  

  He says he supports reducing federal spending and protecting access to abortion. He [voted for](https://www.tester.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tester-statement-on-vote-to-secure-the-southern-border/) the 2024 bipartisan immigration and foreign aid bill that the majority of the Senate Republican caucus blocked.

  He has also expressed concern about Montana’s rising cost of living. 

  “Simply put, the Montana we know and love is changing,” Tester said. “Everything from housing to groceries is more expensive as out-of-state multimillionaires move here and buy up our land, using Montana as their personal playground. With so much changing, we’ve got to have somebody in the Senate who’s willing to fight for our Montana way of life.”
