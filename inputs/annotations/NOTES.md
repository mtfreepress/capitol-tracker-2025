# Annotations

This is intended to be a system for easily adding custom annotations to entities (lawmakers, bills, committees) in the capitol tracker system.

The general design philosophy is that annotations are optional, so that the system will fall back to displaying information automatically pulled from the official bill tracking system or compiled from the official roster unless we annotate it here.
