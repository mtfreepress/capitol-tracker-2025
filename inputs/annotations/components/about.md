### About the 2025 Montana Free Press Capitol Tracker

This guide is an effort to make the quantifiable aspects of the Montana Legislature more accessible to the public by compiling information about lawmakers, proposed bills and the legislative process. This is a project of [Montana Free Press](http://montanafreepress.org/), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit newsroom that aims to provide Montanans with in-depth, nonpartisan news coverage.

The information presented here is collected from a variety of sources including the Montana Legislature's [public roster](https://www.legmt.gov/legislators/) and its [official bill-tracking system](https://bills.legmt.gov/). Reporting and web design were done by Jacob Olness and Eric Dietrich. Please contact them at [jolness@montanafreepress.org](mailto:jolness@montanafreepress.org) and [edietrich@montanafreepress.org](mailto:edietrich@montanafreepress.org) with bug reports, questions or suggestions.
