How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"I grew up in Philadelphia in a Quaker family but became a westerner by 10th grade. I graduated with a BA in Psychology, summa cum laude, from the University of Colorado. My husband and I moved to Montana. Both of my children were born in Billings. I had to move out of state to get my Master's in Social Work but moved back to our favorite state purposefully 15 years ago.  I just turned 70, widowed and retired.  I spent my career working in mental health crisis intervention, case management for the seriously mentally ill, and administration of non-profit mental health agencies.  I have learned to understand that things can always change for the better and how to work hard to make that change happen. "},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"The renewal of Medicaid Expansion, due to be considered in the 2025 Legislature, is the most pressing issue facing Montana. This should be a bipartisan issue but it initially passed by only a few votes. We mustn't take it for granted. Medicaid Expansion has improved the health of our community members, of our work force, and is vital to the well being of our small rural hospitals we all depend on.  A second huge priority is fixing Montana's broken mental health system. We simply cannot do this successfully without Medicaid Expansion. Legislation in both of these areas will be coming from Legislative Leadership and I will do everything I can to help develop it and get it passed. "},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"Tax policy has been an interest of mine ever since I first ran for office eight years ago.  I have studied with experts in Montana revenue, but it is complex.  The recent bust up in property taxes could have been managed using a current mitigation process already known in the Legislature, but the Republican supermajority leadership failed to bring it forward despite prompting by the Democrat minority.  We should make that happen correctly this upcoming session. But our entire Montana tax system needs updating and correction. Our tax brackets are regressive. We need to restore the top tax brackets that were changed in 2003 and repeal tax expenditures that benefit fossil fuel extraction and off shore corporations. "},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"In the short run we must get Medicaid Expansion passed and let's get the insulin cap passed, too. In the long run, I believe we need to have a physical and mental health care system that is non profit and centrally managed as many other countries have successfully developed. In the interim, we need to fund services sufficiently, consistently and expertly rather than by a haphazard process of providing grants. I am a strong supporter of women's rights to a full range of reproductive health services and will promote access to free birth control.  Prenatal and post partum care need to be greatly enhanced. Supporting community based systems such as Community Health Centers and state employee clinics moves us towards coordinated care. "},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"As recently as 2016 half our states had not returned to pre 2008 levels of funding for education following the Great Recession. Montana's state share of higher education funding versus tuition has dropped from 76 percent in 1992 to 38 percent in 2019. The funding recipe for public schools is an attempt to balance local and state and federal funding but it is incredibly complicated. I don't think tinkering will fix it. We need to modernize our tax code as noted above, get our revenue solidified and increase the overall level of funding for the entire range of education.  Funding public pre K helps educate children and let parents work so let's make that happen.  We must target more robust aid to our schools.

The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
