How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"Born Tucson, AZ. 61 years old. Bozeman resident since 2005. BA, Philosophy, Wesleyan University (1985). MBA, Cornell University (1991). Occupation: Business. Father of three public school/MSU attendees. Grew up in a rural farming town (Maryland). Worked in non-profits, spent 30+ years in international satellite communications, built and sold two companies in Bozeman. Active in running community, schools, BridgerCare, business mentoring. Also lived (Hungary, Israel, South Africa) and worked abroad. Love our shared public lands (ultra runner). I want to set aside partisan differences so we can work together to help Montanans become the best version of themselves, and to manage the state better than it has been managed these past few years."},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"(1) Women’s rights: I will defend equality, the right to personal privacy, and the MT State Constitution. (2) Property taxes: (a) The increase was a mistake that we should fix immediately (b) Montana residents should pay a lower tax than non-residents. (c) Renters should not be forgotten. (3) Growth and Affordable Housing: Allow local community input. (4) Medicaid Expansion: Brings medical care, money, and stabilizes the rural healthcare infrastructure. (5) Income tax fairness: We should use our success to invest in the present { bridges and roads} and in the future {public schools, wildlife protection, affordable housing}, instead of destabilizing our finances and shifting tax burden to lower wage earners, like the 2023 Legislature did."},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"(1) Previous legislatures fixed the property tax formula to be fair and not too different from last year’s. The 2023 Legislature didn’t do this, resulting in residential increases and cuts for large corporations. The responsibility lies with the Legislature, not the counties or local governments. Fixing the formula is easy and I’ll join others to make it happen. (2) I propose (a) we set the proportionality of the Residential tax component at a fixed percentage of the Total Property Tax to be Collected, and (b) tax “2nd homes” and “short-term rentals” owned by non-residents at a higher rate than residents pay. (3) Fix the tax system so we can secure funding for public schools from the General Fund. I will learn and offer solutions as I can."},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"(1) Our humanity is defined by how we treat one another. Providing mental and physical health care services is not only the right thing to do, it also is cost-effective and will save taxpayers money in the long run. (2) The Legislature should support Medicaid Expansion that has provided needed health care coverage for working Montanans, helps families and small businesses that rely on these workers, especially important in rural parts of the state. (3) Support local non-profits to provide mental health and service support. (4) Increase funding for substance abuse and mental health programs. (5) DPHHS should do a better job reimbursing local programs and be compassionate in keeping people on assistance rather than trying to kick them off,"},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"Investing in safe, quality education for our children must be a priority. (a) At the least, the current budget cap on inflation increases should be reformed to match inflation. (b) We are a successful state, and there is no better investment a government can make in its people than through public education – we should set a healthy school budget and adjust as needed. (c) We should invest in better pay for teachers and school workforce, including using the state’s success to provide financing support for housing. (d) We should invest in pre-K, with a sensitivity to include current providers. (e) I also strongly support university and vocational program expansion and access, as well as looking to reduce the financial burden on participants."}]},"coverage":[],"primaryResults":{"race":"HD-57","party":"D","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"SCOTT ROSENZWEIG","party":"D","votes":1452,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":1}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:41 PM"},"opponents":[{"slug":"marty-malone","displayName":"MARTY MALONE","summaryLine":null,"party":"R"},{"slug":"scott-rosenzweig","displayName":"SCOTT ROSENZWEIG","summaryLine":null,"party":"D"}]},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
