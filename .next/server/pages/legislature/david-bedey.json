How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"Place of Birth: Hamilton, Montana;  Age: 69;  Residence: Hamilton, Montana;  Occupation: retired U.S. Army colonel (served for 30 years as a combat engineer and on the faculty at the United States Military Academy at West Point), currently working as the chief financial officer for an engineering firm; \n Education: B.S. in Civil Engineering (Montana State University), M.A. in National Security & Strategic Studies (U.S. Naval War College), M.A. in Strategic Studies (U.S. Army War College), Ph.D. in Space Physics (University of Alaska, Fairbanks)"},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"One of the most important things we need to do in the legislature is return to the civility and willingness to work across the aisle that characterized Montana politics before hyper-partisanship originating in Washington, D.C., took hold in our state. This will give us the chance to most effectively address pressing issues, such as providing property tax relief, increasing the supply of attainable housing for our workforce, revamping our mental health system, and bringing innovation into our public schools. I will be working with other legislators to find solutions to these and other challenges that face Montanans."},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":" Property taxes exclusively go toward funding schools, cities, and counties. So cutting local spending would reduce taxes but also would likely cause a reduction in services. Without spending cuts, reducing tax rates shifts the tax burden between property classes (e.g., from residential to agricultural and commercial) or to income tax payers. I am presently one of six legislators serving on Governor Gianforte’s property tax task force, which is carefully weighing several options. Among the most promising is a homestead exemption for a Montana resident’s primary home. Another is expanding current safety net programs for fixed income homeowners. "},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"The legislature in 2025 will consider reauthorization of the Montana HELP Act. Here are facts that will influence my position on this action: Most enrollees work (72%), while 23% are disabled, caretakers, or students. About 60% of Montana businesses have employees enrolled in the program. The financial viability of rural healthcare facilities depends on Medicaid funding; otherwise, they must provide uncompensated care to the poor. The program does not increase funding of abortion because poor women are already eligible for Traditional Medicaid—the same program that covers the elderly. Enrollment decreases when the economy improves. Any effective program must include work requirements."},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"The current school funding formula was crafted to meet the state's constitutional obligation to provide adequate and equitable funding of Montana's public schools. It achieves that objective. That said, it will undergo its next decennial study immediately after the 2025 session comes to a close. This will provide us the opportunity for a thorough and thoughtful update of the formula. One thing that I plan to work on for the 2025 session is relooking the inflation adjustment that is in the formula. In the meantime, the legislature has implemented and is expanding programs to expand career and technical education programs, to encourage innovation in our public schools, and to increase starting pay for new teachers.

The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
