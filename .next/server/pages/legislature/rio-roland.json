How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"I was born in the Turtle Mountains of north-central North Dakota, in Bottineau County. My home is in Bozeman, Montana. I am 46.\n\nI have a Master’s in Urban and Regional Planning from the University of Minnesota and a B.S. in Bioresource Research from Oregon State University. I work for Innergex Renewable Energy as a Senior Resource Analyst – Wind Energy where I design and optimize utility scale windfarms. \n\nMy interests are numerous: skiing, politics, house music, Texas Hold ‘em, hiking, camping, and fly-fishing.\n\nThis variety in upbringing, education, career experiences and hobbies allows me to talk to almost anyone, about almost anything, and provides a strong set of skills to legislate effectively and ardently.\n"},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"Housing - we must increase the supply of affordable and sustainable housing. Taxing out-of-state second-home owners at a higher rate than single-owner in-state residents can be utilized to fund these activities and reduce the burden on residents. Additionally, I support repealing the ban on inclusionary zoning that was passed in 2021. \n\nEnergy policy - Montana stands to profit handsomely from confronting climate change. We have incredible renewable energy resources. We need legislative leadership to enact policies to hasten and facilitate the renewable energy bonanza in Montana. \n\nFairer taxation - I support relying more on income taxes as a larger source of overall funding for the state general fund.\n\nOther pressing issues below."},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"Property taxes are inherently complex and administratively troublesome. They also vary wildly based on boom-bust cycles in property markets and assessed values. Relying on income taxes as a larger source of overall funding for the state general fund reduces uncertainty and can be easily structured to be fairer. I support creating additional income tax brackets for those making over approximately $125,000 to offset lowering the property rate for in-state primary residence homeowners. I also support creating a separate increased rate for out-of-state property owners, and taxing corporate and industrial property owners to levels somewhere between 1994 and now."},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"We need to ensure our residents’ ability to obtain Medicaid and Medicare is as easy as possible.  Montana should expand Medicaid coverage and ensure continuous coverage until re-enrollment eligibility processes are completed by the state. To that end, we need to make certain we have a fully staffed and funded Department of Public Health and Human Services to handle the administrative burdens placed upon it.\n\nFurther, let’s guarantee our rural residents have access to timely and high quality healthcare. Montana should increase our Medicaid reimbursement rates to help keep rural facilities open. "},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"We must eliminate the current 3% cap on inflationary spending for education. We should, at minimum, use the actual inflation rate as the spending increase limit. And, quite frankly, this states’ most important investment is our children and their education; artificial limits on that investment are short-sighted.\nFurther, we have the lowest starting salary for teachers of any state in the nation. Embarrassing. Given Montana’s cost of living, particularly housing, we should have some of the nation’s highest starting salaries our educators. It is paramount in the next legislative session to work toward this goal.\n"}]},"coverage":[],"primaryResults":{"race":"HD-62","party":"D","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"JOSHUA A SECKINGER","party":"D","votes":503,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":0.5289169295478444},{"candidate":"RIO ROLAND","party":"D","votes":448,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.47108307045215564}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:41 PM"},"opponents":[{"slug":"joshua-a-seckinger","displayName":"JOSHUA A SECKINGER","summaryLine":null,"party":"D"},{"slug":"owen-lang","displayName":"OWEN LANG","summaryLine":null,"party":"R"}]},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
