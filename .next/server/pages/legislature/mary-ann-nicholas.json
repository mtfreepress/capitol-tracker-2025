How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"I was born in South Dakota, to a ranching family. We moved to Dillon in 1961; I will be 64 on election day. For the last 12 years I have been a real estate broker, with Beaverhead Home and Ranch in Dillon. Prior to that, I practiced law and had a 30+ year career in banking. I earned my undergraduate degree and law degree from the University of Montana. My background includes a history of working on resource issues , banking and finance including commercial, agriculture and residential areas.  I served on two governor appointed State boards serving the citizens of Montana. I served on the UM-Western Foundation Board and currently serve on the Barrett Hospital Foundation Board. This background informs my understanding of the issues. "},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"Property tax reform is a top issue. There are good solutions to alleviate the recent skyrocketing taxes, including bringing back the Homestead Exemption. Support for mental health is critical. Law enforcement and educators are both impacted by the need for these services. We need to support our rural hospitals through Medicaid Expansion which is vital to the long term stability of our small hospitals and their employees. We have a looming teacher shortage that we should plan for now and we have an affordable housing crisis. We can't keep good teachers or law enforcement if they can't afford to live in our communities. Resource issues critical, such as the infringement of long held private water rights by new claimants. "},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"There are solutions to rising property tax. Currently, short term rentals are subject to the same tax as residential and long-term rentals and second homes are also taxed at the same rate as primary residences, two areas to consider. The Legislature should focus on working within the tax classes to more accurately determine who the rates are intended for. This would help achieve a fairer balance between classes. Property tax rates could be frozen; it makes little sense for someone who has owned a residence for 30 years, to be taxed on the appreciated value, when they haven't realized the gain. The tax could be changed when the residence is sold. And, spending matters. We also need to remember, each county has its own unique circumstance. "},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"Medicaid Expansion is essential to having a healthy work force, it is the most cost effective way to deliver health care to those that don't have insurance, and it is supported overwhelmingly by Montanans. We need to work on a improving our mental health care system which would support law enforcement. Our jails are not designed treat mental health and our communities need services to support those that are in need. In the long term, adequate services will be more cost effective and take pressure off law enforcement and first responders. Montana's Medicaid Expansion funds major investment addressing the behavioral health crisis in our State which is critical. "},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"Our public education system is critical to our democracy. We have to insure school funding is adequate. The State Legislature and our Governor have supported increases in starting teacher pay which we need. Property taxes have already skyrocketed and homeowners aren't able to absorb the current level of tax. A creative problem solving oriented Legislature can come up with solutions.

The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
