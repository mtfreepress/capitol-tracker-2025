How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"I have recently retired from many years of working in the health care policy, workforce development and government relations arena. I have owned a home in Red Lodge since 2000 and it became my permanent residence in 2013, after 20 years living, working and raising a family in Billings, MT. I previously had the honor of serving as the State Legislator (House and Senate) for 16 years for the Billings Heights. During my prior legislative tenure, I worked hard to listen to my constituents and focus on initiatives which promoted public education (lots of school age children in the Heights), fair taxation, small business and workforce development along with ensuring our community and residents had an effective and common sense voice"},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"Folks in Carbon County, a rural community, have shared they want the legislature to focus on pocketbook issues, such as property tax increases, housing affordability, workforce that are critical for rural towns. I served on the Taxation Committees in the past, and worked/voted for homeowner/small business property tax rate reduction--a bipartisan and simple approach used in past sessions. Health care is critical to our community, as we've had several nursing home closures, and I will work on initiatives to reauthorization Medicaid. Recent state actions to. purge Medicaid roles will negatively impact health care for everyone, and jeopardize the financial viability for rural health care providers. Public Education and workforce are also key"},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"As noted, during previous reappraisals, there was bipartisan support to reduce the property tax rates for homeowners and small business. This approach (recommended in Nov, 2022) was ignored and resulted in over $200 million in permanent property tax increases for homeowners/small businesses. The blame on local governments is factually incorrect. We need to lower the rates and stop the ongoing shift of property taxes from large corporations to homeowners. Homeowners are now paying over 50% of property tax; we need to adjustthe appraisal process/valuation for other classes of property tax to ensure fairness, expand senior citizen exemptions (on property tax), include renters in our efforts and continue expanding housing."},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"First, the state needs to take quick meaningful action to requalify those eligible for Medicaid! The state leadership kicked off 60% due to procedural issues, This means.,leaving low income families without access to care—including mental health and also forefeiting millions of dollars in Federal funding(our tax dollars). Rural facilities are at risk of closure (2 nursing homes closed in RL)The legislature should pass legislation to renew and fund the state share of Medicaid Expansion and reinstate 12 month eligibility. The legislature, unfortunately, may need to \"micro manage\" this process; i.e. add temporary staff. We also need to expand health access in rural areas through incentives to recruit and retain—including workforce housing."},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"Yes, I believe that education is critical to our children and Montana’s economy; School funding is complicated however we need to 1) increase base funding 2) avoid shifting to local property owners 3) stop sipping money from public schools through charter schools and tax incentives for private schools., Rural areas may need additional help to recruit and retain teachers, I would propose changes to the school funding formula to increase the state share and help students obtain workforce training or college credits while high school (other states do this) and consider putting more funding in programs rather than buildings.

The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
