How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"I was born and raised in the Flathead Valley and attended kindergarten through 12th grades in the Columbia Falls school district, graduating in 2000. I attended a private Christian College in Pennsylvania for undergrad and Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland for graduate school. I now live in between Whitefish and Columbia Falls and my children attend the Columbia Falls school district as well. I have worked for Logan Health/Kalispell Regional Medical Center since 2009 as an adolescent therapist in the acute inpatient psychiatric hospital, school based, and outpatient counseling settings. If elected, I believe my experience as a local Montanan, wife, mother, and mental health therapist will equip me to be an effective legislator."},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"I believe there are many pressing issues facing Montana in the 2025 legislative session including high property taxes for homeowners, sweeping cuts in health insurance coverage, ongoing cuts in mental health funding, dangerous restrictions being placed on women’s rights & rights to privacy, substantial cuts in the public education system, and restrictions to Montanan’s access to public lands. I also believe it is crucial to support public employee unions and ensure that all Montana Veterans have access to services they have earned by serving our country. Legislation that I would propose/support would focus on maintaining the safety, health, and quality of life for all Montana citizens regardless of gender, ethnicity or socioeconomic status."},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"The property tax system is complicated, will have no simple solution; however, must be addressed. The recent changes to the state tax system by the legislature during the 2023 legislative session placed the majority of the burden on the general Montana population by giving huge tax breaks to corporations and the wealthiest residents and/or nonresidents. The tax burden ought to be shared equally across all property owners whether it be business, industry, or private/residential. Taxes placed on the marijuana industry could also be allocated to pay for essential services. "},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"Physical and mental health care services are essential to the well being of all Montanans. Over 130,00 people have lost health insurance coverage between 4/23 and 1/24. Montana currently ranks 3rd in the nation for suicide, Flathead County is 3rd in the state. All residents in Montana are impacted negatively by poor physical and mental health of its residents be that by lost job productivity or citizens’ contributions to the community. Research indicates that economic effects of expanding healthcare coverage to low income Montanans would introduce $650 million into the economy each year, support 6,000 new jobs, and add $400 million in personal income. It is the job of the Legislature to enhance and improve access to healthcare services. "},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"Montana currently ranks last the country for starting teacher pay. There are currently over 1,000 job openings throughout the state in education. Public education is the ultimate equalizer in our society for individuals of any background, ethnicity, and income level to establish a path toward success and achievement in life. Funding public education is the primary job of the legislature. In order to provide quality education to our children, teachers must be paid a living wage, curriculum must be inclusive and varied, and our educational structures must be maintained appropriately. Property owners be they individuals or entities must have commiserate amounts of responsibility in funding our education system.

The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
