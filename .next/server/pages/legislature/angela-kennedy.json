How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"I was born in the early 60’s into a large Lutheran Navy family in Virginia and am 63. \n\nMy parents moved to Colorado, where I lived for 54 years and I worked in semiconductor manufacturing and sales starting with Texas Instruments in 1981. Over my career, have consulted to food, finance, military, high tech, bio technological pharmaceutical and petrochemical manufacturers. I moved to Montana in 2017 to work with Applied Materials. \n\nI hold a Master’s Degree from Regis University, in Denver, in Business Operations and Project Management and I hold a Professional Project Manager, PMP certification. \n\nI look forward to serving Montana. \n"},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"We need to address worker wages in light of record corporate profits. Address the issue of affordability and availability of housing for working and Montanans on fixed incomes. \nProtecting the future by ensuring we protect and pass on a stable climate system, as well as safeguarding and improving public education.\nDefend the Right to Privacy as written in the Constitution which supports a woman's right to maintain a choice when related to her reproductive rights.\nWe need to balance the current ultra conservative super-majority in the state legislature and ensure we protect all types of human diversity and do not allow overstepping our honored system of human rights and freedom and insure checks and balances support this.  \n"},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"The current majority of ultra conservative legislators have failed to maintain equalization between Corporate and Residential property taxes. Tax revenue generated by Residential Taxes increased by over $250 million last year and Corporate taxes declined by over $75 million.  Working as your State Senator, I commit to working to support an adjustment to our property tax formula. \n\nThe Governor could have easily done what his predecessors have done and adjusted the rate, but chose to implement a rebate program and a task for at additional cost to taxpayers\n"},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"Affordable public health insurance for all US Citizens needs to be in place that will cover mental health. I fully support this ongoing initiative and the closer we get to 100% coverage, critical mental and physical healthcare services become more easily available. With the current conservative majority in local and federal legislation this will continue to not exist, as private health insurance is really quite profitable and deeply entrenched.\n\nWe must stay up to date by addressing funding needs. In 2025, Medicaid Expansion is up for reauthorization. A very high percentage of participants are low wage working Montanan's whose access to mental health care is dependent on this program. \n"},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"The current per student funding formulas will need to be reviewed and addressed to see if that can be raised per/student. Next we need to look at an overall boost to our teacher’s starting salaries and the salaries over the life of their careers. We need to be able to recruit the best and brightest teachers, and ranking 51st in the US in teacher salaries is not allowing for that. \nAt a minimum, Montana should be willing to provide budget authority to districts to increase, with the next budget approval period, a minimum increase of 5%/year and provide additional state funding for the Guaranteed Tax Base supporting schools and education.  \n"}]},"coverage":[],"primaryResults":{"race":"SD-3","party":"D","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"ANGELA KENNEDY","party":"D","votes":1377,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":1}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:41 PM"},"opponents":[{"slug":"carl-glimm","displayName":"CARL GLIMM","summaryLine":null,"party":"R"},{"slug":"angela-kennedy","displayName":"ANGELA KENNEDY","summaryLine":null,"party":"D"}]},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
