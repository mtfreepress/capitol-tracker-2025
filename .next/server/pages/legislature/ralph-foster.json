How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"Born in Ironton, MO., I'm 61 & have lived in Montana for 40 years moving here after I completed my education from the State of Kansas Regent System where I attained my professional education to be a Mortician. The last 26 years I have made St. Ignatius my residence with my wife , Phyllis Haynes. We own Foster Funeral Home & Crematory with locations in St. Ignatius & Browning. We sold Browning in Nov. 2023 to make time for my wife's recovery from a liver transplant. I am an excellent candidate because like many in my district  my wife is a member of the CSKT, & our business is incorporated under the Tribe. However, since my families ancestry is from OK we follow Federal, State & Tribal laws/rules and understand how they work together."},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"In our area it has to be retro-session of the Public Law. In the past legislators have been able to pass only modest solutions to the problem and the State has yet to fund it. For this reason I would advocate that the State withdraw and let the Reservations function more as Sovereign Nations under the Yakama Accord unless their is a compact or federal mandate to have the State government act in that capacity. That way the Federal Government would have address the issue and possibly could come up with a solution."},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"I would set property values at the price a family paid for the property. Commercial property (non agriculture based) would retain the current system. I am for property tax relief but this does not affect most of HD15 as the majority of my constituents have property in Trust Status and massive areas of this district are recognized wilderness areas."},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"Expansion should be sought., However, accountability standards should be enacted on recipients. Limits to discretionary spending of funds by the recipient should be put into force that would restrict their purchasing of alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes and gaming.\nIn regards to our state run facilities which have been under scrutiny and seem to be failing we should look to see if privatization is better for them."},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"Having a father that has been a member of the State Of Kansas Regents Board, I have seen him struggle with this issue and there is not an easy boiler plate answer to it. \n Most solutions are not pleasant but consolidation is usually necessary evil & the offering of duplicate courses must be examined. Most states with populations as sparse as Montana do not have as many colleges as Montana does. As for k-12 funding it should be based upon number of students that live within a district. By doing this home school, private school, & charter school families still contribute to the solution. Also because of the amount of federal and state lands that some districts have negotiations would be appropriate to have them raise their contributions."}]},"coverage":[],"primaryResults":{"race":"HD-15","party":"R","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"RALPH FOSTER","party":"R","votes":714,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":1}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:41 PM"},"opponents":[{"slug":"ralph-foster","displayName":"RALPH FOSTER","summaryLine":null,"party":"R"},{"slug":"thedis-crowe","displayName":"THEDIS CROWE","summaryLine":null,"party":"D"}]},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
