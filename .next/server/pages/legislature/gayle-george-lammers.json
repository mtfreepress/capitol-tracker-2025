How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"Born in Hardin, Montana. 39 Years old. Living in Hardin, Montana. Self employed at a 5th generation family Business. Lammers Trading Post. I pride myself in the deep connection, running a long standing, trusted family business in my community has provided. I have developed a trust and mutual respect with the diverse constituency of Senate district 21. My family has served the area proudly for 5 generations. My wife Carla and I have Three beautiful children. Leila, Luna and George. I plan on bringing my common sense conservative approach to the State Legislature to help create and maintain a more prosperous Montana. "},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"Taxes, Inflation and Public safety are at the top of my list. Out of control spending at all levels of government have devalued the US dollar and caused prices of common goods, activities and property taxes to spike across the board. This has created less opportunity for our citizens and harbored low moral environment. This leads to crime, poverty and low standard of living. I will work with all members of the Legislature and continue to work with my community toward solutions. Rein in Government spending at all levels, Increase funding where it is needed to fight crime and strive to provide Montanans with a lower cost of living. "},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"When it comes to high property taxes, the root problem is inflation. Devaluing the US dollar has driven prices higher in every aspect of our lives. Property taxes have risen partly because of inflated home prices, which result in higher tax assessments. Another large problem is the wasteful spending at all levels of government. From DC to City hall. The traditional “spend all you can to get all you can” must stop. I support lowering taxes for Montanans at all levels. Tax caps, Assessment rules and caps, re thinking how we create and maintain budgets at state and local levels. I plan on bringing my common sense business forward, balanced spending approach to help solve the now glaring tax problems we face. "},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"Medicaid expansion is a subject that deserves much attention and consideration. Montanans are struggling in rural as well as urban areas to find adequate health services. Help from the Legislature is needed to cut the red tape involved in acquiring adequate mental and physical health care for all and especially less fortunate Montanans. Mental health is the root of so many problems we face in Montana. Everyone deserves a helping hand when they are willing or unable to help themselves. "},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"This is a subject that will require a lot of out of the box thinking. New approaches to raise revenue for our schools is paramount in maintaining a prosperous Montana. Less wasteful spending. School budget reform. More independent fundraising. Less costly regulation. More incentive for good teachers. Reform of Tax revenue and how funds are allocated and spent. The funding is there. I believe that a common sense business minded look at the way those funds are spent, would go a long way!

The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
