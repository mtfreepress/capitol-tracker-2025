How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"I was born, raised, and educated in Helena, Montana. I currently reside in Helena with my wife, Virginia, and our two daughters. I will be 46 on election day. I work as a software engineer and data analyst for an accounting and business advisory firm. I graduated with a B.A. in computer science with a minor in political science from Carroll College. I served on the Helena Public Schools Board of Trustees for six years, from 2017-2023. I served as Board Chair for three years, from 2019-2022, and chaired the Budget & Finance, Facilities & Maintenance, and Policy Committees at various times during my tenure. I served on the Montana School Boards Association Board of Directors from 2017-2023, and served as President in 2021-2022."},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"The Montana Legislature must ensure that our public school funding formula fulfills Article X of the Montana Constitution, which begins \"It is the goal of the people to establish a system of education which will develop the full educational potential of each person.\" While our students and their families are very well served by Montana's public educators and locally governed school districts, mounting evidence suggests they are struggling to meet the needs of their students with the available resources. We have a moral and constitutional imperative to invest in our children's education, and the failure to do so will also undermine economic growth and opportunity. The next Legislature must bolster our investment in Montana's children."},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"Montana families are understandably concerned about the drastic increase in their residential property taxes which have substantially outpaced inflation. However, we must recognize that property taxes are a critical source of investment in public education and many other public goods. Article VIII of the Montana Constitution diagnoses the problem and compels the solution: \"The state shall appraise, assess, and equalize the valuation of all property which is to be taxed in the manner provided by law.\" Our current system places an unfair burden on residential property owners. The next Legislature must ensure that we equalize residential home valuations with corporate and other business property classes."},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"The Montana Legislature joined 41 other states in 2015 to expand Medicaid coverage, which has enabled many Montanans in low-income jobs or part-time work due to disabilities to afford healthcare. By providing access to mental and physical healthcare services, more Montana children were able to attend school and learn while more people were able to continue working to support their families. Furthermore, the vast majority of the costs are paid for by the federal government. Investing in the health of our low-income children and families is not only a moral imperative, but a widely acclaimed policy to bolster our economy and reduce state expenditures. The next Legislature must renew Medicaid expansion."},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"Public school districts across Montana are facing growing budget deficits while doing their best to support and educate our children, an increasing number of whom are struggling with poverty, isolation, and pandemic related learning loss. We must ensure that our state funding formula is addressing the growing needs of our students while keeping pace with the increasing costs of meeting their needs. Article X of the Montana Constitution provides that \"Equality of educational opportunity is guaranteed to each person of the state.\" Our funding formula must therefore acknowledge that some students will need more services than others to reach their full potential and provide resources accordingly to the public schools that serve them."}]},"coverage":[],"primaryResults":{"race":"HD-79","party":"D","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"LUKE MUSZKIEWICZ","party":"D","votes":1210,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":0.5694117647058824},{"candidate":"EMILY HARRIS","party":"D","votes":783,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.3684705882352941},{"candidate":"ANNE WOODLAND","party":"D","votes":132,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.06211764705882353}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:41 PM"},"opponents":[{"slug":"jill-sark","displayName":"JILL SARK","summaryLine":null,"party":"R"},{"slug":"luke-muszkiewicz","displayName":"LUKE MUSZKIEWICZ","summaryLine":null,"party":"D"}]},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
