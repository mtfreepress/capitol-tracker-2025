How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"-Born in Augusta, Kennebec County, Maine\n-66 years old as of General Election Day\n-Permanent Residency is Missoula, Montana\n-Occupation/Employer: English Language Tutor/MCPS and Ombuds/UTHSC College of Medicine\n\nAs a first-generation college graduate, raised by a single mom due to the death of my dad when I was young, I learned the value of public education and hard work. Through scholarships, loans and public medical school, I was able to become a doctor who specialized in pediatric cancer care and then pediatric hospice. Through this I learned that the most complicated decisions are extremely personal and require listening carefully to family and patient values in order to best advocate for them. I would do the same for my voters.\n\n"},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"There are many pressing issues that need legislation and advocating for change. However, I think the most pressing issue that needs addressing prior to or while proposing legislation is communication. Connecting across the aisle and having civil conversations for shared, sensible solutions is imperative. I do realize that this requires effort on both sides of the aisle. If elected, I will do what I have done when I testified, as a citizen in Helena in the 2023 session, and work to connect across the aisle while still standing up for my values and the needs of Montanans."},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"I support lowering the residential tax rate, when assessed taxable values skyrocket as they did this year. I support eliminating the ability for centrally-assessed companies (telecom, railroads and others that cross county lines) to negotiate their tax rates or at least make the negotiations transparent to the public. I support allowing local communities to enact tax decisions that make sense for their communities."},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"I believe that the Legislature must ensure that health insurance for our lower income Montanans, which is usually Medicaid, continues and is not put in jeopardy each session. This healthcare should cover mental health services and provide care for those with substance use issues. Our rural and critical access hospitals are essential for rural Montanans and depend on Medicaid to remain fiscally viable and available to provide care services to patients in those areas. Without these hospitals and this healthcare coverage, the health of many Montanans will be harmed."},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"The problem with funding at the pre-K-12 level, as with higher education and vocational training programs, is adequacy. We are not dedicating the level of funding necessary to meet our constitutional promise to develop the full educational potential of all persons. We need to pay teachers at a level that will attract and retain them, from kindergarten through college and vocational education. We need to support curriculum at a level that ensures students can develop their unique talents, as well as have their unique needs met. We need to ensure that education beyond high school is affordable so that the debt level graduates incur, coupled with the housing crisis they face in Montana. will not force them to leave our amazing state."}]},"coverage":[],"primaryResults":{"race":"HD-97","party":"D","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"MELODY CUNNINGHAM","party":"D","votes":1341,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":0.8308550185873605},{"candidate":"LISA VERLANIC FOWLER","party":"D","votes":273,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.1691449814126394}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:41 PM"},"opponents":[{"slug":"melody-cunningham","displayName":"MELODY CUNNINGHAM","summaryLine":null,"party":"D"},{"slug":"richard-l-armerding","displayName":"RICHARD L ARMERDING","summaryLine":null,"party":"L"},{"slug":"nick-knowles","displayName":"NICK KNOWLES","summaryLine":null,"party":"R"}]},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
