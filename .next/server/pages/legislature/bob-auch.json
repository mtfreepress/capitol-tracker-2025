How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"I was born in Norristown PA and will be 67 years old on election day 2024. My wife Linda and I have been living in Yellowstone county since 1991 and in my current house district since 2003. I retired in 2021 after working a variety of jobs throughout the years. I have worked in retail, law enforcement, financial services, custodial and even at the Billings Air Tanker base. Throughout my 52 years of employment I have learned to work with a wide variety of people from varying backgrounds. Being successful requires common sense, reasoning and compromise. Carrying these skills to the legislature I believe I could be an effective representative of my district."},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"As I have been talking to voters, I have found everyone has their own most pressing issue, as determined by their current situation. While everything can’t be addressed for everyone, I believe the place we start is with public education. Without a quality public education system we have no future. Today’s students are tomorrow’s leaders. Public education needs to be properly and equitably funded to ensure every student has the opportunity to achieve their greatest potential. Whether a student becomes a doctor, an attorney or a mechanic or construction worker, all contribute to a healthy economy and a positive future for Montana."},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"I would support any reasonable, common sense solution that truly benefits those that need it. State Democrats have a proposal that would lower property taxes for working Montanans and protect against future tax hikes. It includes a $50,000 homestead exemption to Montana residents and a $200,000 exemption for small businesses. It includes a tiered residential property tax rate that would cut taxes for low and middle income Montanans, while making sure those owning mansions pay their fair share. The plan also includes a tax credit to ensure working families and retired people don’t have property taxes rising above their ability to pay. "},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"To answer the question directly, the state needs to provide a streamlined process to allow every individual or guardian to apply for Medicaid quickly and easily.\nWhen the continuous Medicaid coverage requirement ended in 2023, Montana began the redetermination process. As a result of this process, over 125,000 Montanans lost their Medicaid coverage. While the redetermination process may be legitimate, the methods used by the Gianforte administration are not. Many of those removed don’t realize they have been removed until they show up at a clinic and are told they don’t have coverage. The process to regain coverage is made more difficult by the lack of state assistance to those who don’t have internet access, don’t understand the forms,"},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"I fully believe public tax dollars should stay in public schools. While everyone has the right to send their student to a private school, whether religious, a school for disabled or even home school, that should be at their expense. Every education dollar sent to private schools is one less dollar available for public education, which is still required by law to provide an education for every student, not just those it chooses to accept. Rather than creating schemes to funnel tax dollars to private institutions, the legislature should be working on a fair distribution of state funding to all public schools across the state. We need plans to attract and retain qualified educators across the state in both large and small districts."}]},"coverage":[],"primaryResults":{"race":"HD-40","party":"D","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"BOB AUCH","party":"D","votes":484,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":1}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:41 PM"},"opponents":[{"slug":"mike-vinton","displayName":"MIKE VINTON","summaryLine":null,"party":"R"},{"slug":"bob-auch","displayName":"BOB AUCH","summaryLine":null,"party":"D"}]},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
