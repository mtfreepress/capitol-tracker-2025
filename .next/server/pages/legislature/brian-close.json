How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"Birth: Northbrook IL;\nAge: 65;\nOccupation: Attorney;\nEducation:\nUniversity of Chicago A.B. History (General Honors) 1981;\nIIT-Chicago Kent School of Law J.D. 1986;\nNew York University Law School, LL.M - Taxation 1987; Montana State University Masters inn History, 2000.\n\nAs a practicing attorney for 40 years I am well prepared to deal with legislation and complex legal issues, especially in the area of taxation as I am a tax attorney.\n\nI have a long record of public service in the areas of seniors, public health, transportation, government (co-wrote the city charter), planning, and parks. I am well versed in the many issues I will face as a legislator."},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"Property tax reform. The current system is unconscionable. We need to reduce the overall tax rate, require MDOR to equalize properties as required by law, and provide additional relief for people on fixed incomes.\n\nAffordable Housing. The housing authority statute needs to be modernized (it was written in 1935) and additional government solutions to housing in support of local government need to be devised. The current market centric solutions are not working\n\nMedicaid Renewal is a must, as it stabilizes rural hospitals, enhances employment, reduces overall health care costs, and  is a good deal for the state\n\nWe need to re-pass, and overide a veto if necessary, legislation making it easier for seniors to stay in their homes. "},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"First, there is still $1 billion of unallocated surplus. The tax burden on individual taxpayers need to be shifted back to corporate taxpayers. In 1993 the burden was 38%, now it is 58% and the corporate burden has been reduced. NWE needs to pay more and you and me less.\n\nThat said, the simplest solution would be to reduce the overall tax rates as MDOR proposed in 2022. Further, we need to look at providing additional relief to people on fixed incomes."},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"DPHHS is a mess. Additional funding may be needed to coordinate all the various health programs adminsistered by the state.\n\nI know this has been a topic of one of the interim committees.\n\nEligibility for Mediciad Expansion in the reauthorization should be as liberal as CMS will allow.\n\nFunding for substance abuse and mental health should be increased.\n\nLocal medicaid providers should be reimbursed for the additional costs they incurred because of the mismanaged Medicaid review "},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"We need a corporate surtax dedicated to all levels of education, restoring the balance that existed 30 years ago. This is a problem 30 years in the making. The top tax rate on individuals also needs to be increased."}]},"coverage":[],"primaryResults":{"race":"HD-65","party":"D","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"BRIAN CLOSE","party":"D","votes":855,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":0.6159942363112392},{"candidate":"ANJA WOOKEYHUFFMAN","party":"D","votes":533,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.3840057636887608}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:41 PM"},"opponents":[{"slug":"brian-close","displayName":"BRIAN CLOSE","summaryLine":null,"party":"D"},{"slug":"esther-fishbaugh","displayName":"ESTHER FISHBAUGH","summaryLine":null,"party":"R"}]},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
