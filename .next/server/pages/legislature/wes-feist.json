How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"Helena, MT\n40\nEast Helena, MT\nBusiness Operations Analyst with the MT Dept of Admin and City Council Member with the City of East Helena\n(B.S.) - Management from Johnson & Wales University\n(M.A.) - Higher Education from the University of Denver\nMy current role seeks and applies project cost savings and process improvement. For over 15 years I served students and job seekers through career advisement, post-secondary career attainment, and financial accountability in education and workforce development programming. \nI also serve my hometown of East Helena as a council member, with a focus on responsible economic development, strong and community-driven law enforcement, and city growth that doesn't force costs on current residents."},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"Property tax reform is the most pressing issue facing Montnanans. I would propose or support a long term solution to balance the method in which mills are determined and ensure that if a surplus occurs due to property tax revenue, the money is returned to all property owners. We also need to address Montana second homes and short term rentals and at what rate those property taxes are collected. Other ideas to reduce and control property taxes include basing property tax levels on purchase/selling price, removing the need to evaluate based on often arbitrary appraised values. Additionally, placing a cap on any property tax increases is needed to limit taxation. "},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"To address this issue, I have noted possible solutions steps above. Additionally, the Legislature needs to redetermine school funding mechanisms and take into consideration technology and safety/security needs that are ever changing. Local municipalities also need to find ways to be more fiscally conservative to utilize local taxes more responsibly. I am proud of how, in recent years, the East Helena budget is determined and executed with residents' concerns and best interests in mind to stretch every dollar as far as possible. "},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"There are numerous programs and funding sources currently available that can better collaborate, cost-share, and cross fund. Streamlining services needs to be a priority. I proudly served on the State Rehabilitation Council that provided insight and guidance to the state and federal funding sources to help those with disabilities find and secure educational and workforce development programs that fit their long-term needs for independent living. The Voc Rehab programs are great examples of collaborative and life changing assistance with strong and measurable goals and outcomes. When publicly available programs creatively find ways to braid funding resources and utilize other existing programs they are much more successful for those in need."},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"The legislature can ensure that all families and students have adequate funding by focusing on schools, districts, teachers, and programs with strong outcomes and not rewarding those with weak and low performance outcomes. Additionally, the funding formula should take into account rapidly changing programs like Career and Technical Education (CTE), technology in the classroom and schools, and school safety and security. The annual increases should also more closely align, but not always follow, inflation.

The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
