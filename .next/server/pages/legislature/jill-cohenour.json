How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"I was born in Havre, MT, up on the Hi-line. I will be 58 this year. I went to UofM and received a bachelor’s in chemistry. I work at the Montana State Environmental Laboratory in Helena testing private wells and public water supplies, as well as environmental samples for harmful chemicals. I work with federal, state, tribal and local partners on water quality. Joe and I live in East Helena. As a scientist I can explain situations to diverse groups of people and help use facts and data to drive decisions based on our shared Montana values. I was raised in a rural, agricultural community that gave me an appreciation and love for our Montana lands. Taxes are my avocation."},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"In Housing, we did nothing it help increase the number of available affordable housing units during the last session. We must provide additional tax credits to match federal ones to make building affordable units pencil out. We can also create a housing trust to allow more investment in local community efforts.\nWomen’s healthcare must be protected. \nThe decennial study of education funding is coming in the 2025-2026 interim. The configuration of that study, crafting the desperately needed changes for rural and urban school districts in the 2027 session, will be a critical project of the 2025 Legislature.\n\n"},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"Property Taxes will be addressed in the next session. Increasing the homestead exemption for low-income Montanans and using income tax to reduce the property tax obligation on low-income Montanans will provide help to those that need it the most. Increasing school funding from the state level will relieve some pressure locally. Allowing for SB442 to relieve burdens of road maintenance will also help reduce any increases locally. "},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"The legislature needs to step in and maintain the Medicaid program in DPHHS that was purposefully undermined. Upwards of 100,000 Montanans have been kicked off. The Governor paid $2m for a contractor to make recommendations to improve the workplace at the State Hospital. Very few recommendations have been implemented to improve the situation. DPHHS has not been paying local community healthcare providers for both healthcare and mental health services already provided, delaying the payments so community providers are being forced to close their doors. Protecting these community-based services should be a top priority for the legislature. We have worked for years to place services in local areas to improve access and need to keep them."},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"The Montana Legislature must increase state funding of schools and address the needs of both rural and urban schools in the new funding formula. The percent of state funding of schools has gone down over the last many years which requires local mill levies to increase dramatically just to maintain current levels of programs. Investing in a sustainable funding mechanism will allow schools to provide quality educational experiences to kids all over Montana. We also need to pay our teachers better, keeping our Montana educated teachers here rather than losing them to other states. A statewide teacher salary schedule could address this issue."}]},"coverage":[],"primaryResults":{"race":"HD-83","party":"D","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"JILL COHENOUR","party":"D","votes":1735,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":1}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:41 PM"},"opponents":[{"slug":"jill-cohenour","displayName":"JILL COHENOUR","summaryLine":null,"party":"D"},{"slug":"wes-feist","displayName":"WES FEIST","summaryLine":null,"party":"R"}]},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
