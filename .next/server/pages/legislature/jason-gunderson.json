How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"I was born and raised in Libby, MT, and I am 39 years old. After graduating high school, I traveled around and gained experience as a Firefighter EMT and Police Officer. I returned to Montana for good and now live in Livingston, MT. I am a Patrol Sergeant for my police department, President of our non-profit, and VP of our union. I have a Bachelor's in Criminal Justice Studies. My two decades of public service experience in emergency services has made me a hardworking, ethical, lifelong learner. I understand the importance of self-sacrifice, teamwork, and compromise to solve complex problems. Effective legislators utilize their past experiences, recognize their shortcomings, and seek enlightenment from others through their constituents."},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"Property Taxes, Medicaid Expansion, Cartels, Mental Health, Marijuana Tax, and Judicial Accountability, to name just a few. In Livingston, we have had multiple new taxes levied against our community. We need to ease this burden and ensure that money is being put towards basic, frontline services and not local government pet projects. By redirecting some of our marijuana tax, we can greatly improve the usability and safety of Montana’s roads by funding road materials, plow trucks, fire trucks, and police training. We have generated 113 million marijuana tax revenue, I think my plan is a realistic solution to a number of problems Montana faces. "},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"We need to cap the percentage that our property tax can increase, reduce developmental regulations, and local governments need to adjust their growth policies. The Airbnb market and tax incentives for rentals should also be evaluated for potential solutions. The biggest contributor to this issue however is supply which has greatly increased property values. Our legislators managed to implement a short-term solution by giving the People their money back which I am thankful they did instead of going on a shopping spree with our tax dollars. The surplus we have now is a one-time deal and should not be used to create new ongoing debt. The financial bubble we are in has been going on too long and we need to prepare for the pop. "},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"The obvious answer is Medicaid Expansion, but the new problem is how Montana will pay for it. My understanding is our hospitals used temporary money to fund permanent debt, and now Montana has an over 120-million-dollar gun to its head. It’s the ultimate budgeting sin and now we must figure this out. I also see a need to restore local mental health services and child advocacy centers. Livingston lost both of those resources several years ago and it has had a substantial impact on our community. I just hope we can afford all of these programs with all the other competing needs of our State. "},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"How do we expect to keep what we have, let alone grow, when we are cutting revenue streams? Bring back timber, precious metal, and energy production so we can stop treating property owners as State piggy banks to shake whenever we want things. We need profitable natural resource projects that prioritize environmental and personal health. Having grown up in Libby, I understand the importance of environmental and health protections and bad actor accountability. So with those new dollars, I would prioritize K-12 and K-12 Trade Programs. Priority would also be given to schools that empower parents as the decision makers for their children’s education and teachers who teach children HOW to think, instead of WHAT to think.

The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
