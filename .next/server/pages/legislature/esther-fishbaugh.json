How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"I am a 4th generation Montanan born in Billings, Montana having lived in Montana all 66 years of my life. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from the College of Great Falls in 1984 and obtained a Master of Science degree from Montana State University in 1991. I have lived in Bozeman since 1984 and started a property management company in 1986 that contracts with the federal government. My husband and I incorporated this business in 1997 and I work as CEO. Working with government contracts in Montana and Wyoming, and the many business realities including hiring and paying employees has given me a strong education in political climates and business issues. Regulation must be carefully crafted to nurture healthy work environments."},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"Federal encroachment on personal and state freedoms must be addressed. States must reclaim their proper functions and limit federal overreach. State law needs to be more explicit in remedies such as recall guidelines and bonding requirements for when our elected officials act outside of their enumerated powers or fail to fulfill their duties of office. Transparency in the law-making process and financial expenditures is needed to illuminate wasteful spending; mandated online annual reporting is needed. Property tax increases need to be capped to no more than 10% in any one year and property tax relief given to the elderly on fixed incomes."},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"Taxation should never be separated from expenditures. Every school and state department should post online their current request for funding, their current funding sources and amounts and their past three years of expenditures. Each department should have a published statement on what their main function is; expenditures outside of the main focus would then become obvious as financials are also published. A state-funded task force of business experts could be utilized to help each department or school district find efficiencies through technology or innovative restructuring. "},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"The current health-care system in America is broken and in need of critical scrutiny. The unhealthy monetization of disease treatments needs to be abolished. Freedom to choose medical care should be enhanced and barriers to innovative healthcare delivery removed such as obstacles to subscription services by family doctors. Fraud in the Medicare system needs to be aggressively prosecuted as well as price gouging by pharmaceutical companies and medical device companies. The best outcome for health delivery is to remove third parties that stand between the health care provider and the patient.  "},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"Education delivery has not kept up with technology and needs to be rethought. Parents consistently support more choice in education opportunities such as homeschooling, private schools, charter schools, vocational and public schools. Public schools may better serve as education centers that parents can choose what their child needs from a variety of services. Better use of current facilities to serve growing student population should be considered. Allowing for schools to hire teachers from professional backgrounds without teaching certificates would help alleviate teacher shortages. Efficiencies may be gained by regulatory relief on required administrative positions.

The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
