How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"I was born in Pittsburgh PA in 1960, and lived there until I was 16. However as children we spent a lot of time in Dubois, WY, eventually moving to Dubois, where I finished High School. I then went to college in Bozeman MT at MSU in 1978, and have lived in Montana ever since. Currently my wife Traci and I live in Park county on Bozeman Pass, where we have raised our family, and lived for over 40 Years. I am currently a retired teacher of over 30 years, having taught for the Livingston School Dist., and MSU. I have been very active In Livingston & Park Co., and feel that I have a strong relationship and understanding of our diverse community. Being a teacher and lifelong learner I have a lot of experience and interest in a variety of topics"},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"There are going to many pressing issues as we enter the 2025 session. Medicaid expansion/admin, property taxes, affordable housing, mental health, and education just to name a few. Medicaid expansion in MT sunsets in 2025, so it is imperative that the state reenrolls in that, and that we find better methods of administering access to it for Montanans that need it. We also must find more solutions to affordable housing besides reducing regulations, which many now oppose. We need to look at tax incentives for builders, developers, landlords, and towns that create truly affordable housing. I will also support sustainable solutions to finding property tax relief for many MT’s, part of which includes making sure corporations pay their share. "},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"The GOP controlled state legislature and Governor failed to sustainably address the expected rise in property taxes, resulting in MT residents paying on average 21% more than they were paying. It was well known in the legislature that the short term $675 tax rebates implemented during the session were not a long term solution, and did little to relieve the cost & anxiety Montana property owners are experiencing. Certain proposals were put forth last session that did offer tax relief for MT's but were ignored. If elected I will represent the people of Montana in finding long term solutions to restructuring our property tax system, providing relief for those that need it, while ensuring the wealthy, and big corporations pay their fair share."},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"Medicaid Expansion in MT sunsets in 2025. It is very important that the legislature re-enrolls in that program, so as a state we can afford the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans. This is also important so that mental & healthcare providers can afford to offer their services. In 2023 after the COVID era all states had to re-align their Medicaid enrollment. In MT the Governor has administered a deeply flawed process leading to over 120,000 Montanans to lose services. Some numbers: 70,000 were due to administrative reasons, Nearly 36,000 children have had their coverage terminated, 13,000 Native folks coverage terminated, including over4,000 Native children, over 7,600 seniors kicked off their insurance. This needs fixed!"},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"School funding is very complicated. Revenue comes from many sources: city, county, state, and federal, and is allocated in various ways. Currently the funding formula used by the state is antiquated, and limiting, and needs addressed. Whatever the case, it is duly noted that we need to invest more in our youth, and that the legislature really needs to look at the current formula, and actively find solutions. Being an educator for 30+ years this is an issue dear to my heart, and I look forward to working hard to find meaningful solutions. Describing possible solutions with a 750-character limit is impossible, however stating that I am devoted and dedicated to our educational systems and the youth they serve is easy!"}]},"coverage":[],"primaryResults":{"race":"HD-58","party":"D","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"JAMIE L ISALY","party":"D","votes":1362,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":0.9116465863453815},{"candidate":"DEAN WILLIAMSON","party":"D","votes":132,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.08835341365461848}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:41 PM"},"opponents":[{"slug":"jason-gunderson","displayName":"JASON GUNDERSON","summaryLine":null,"party":"R"},{"slug":"jamie-l-isaly","displayName":"JAMIE L ISALY","summaryLine":null,"party":"D"}]},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
