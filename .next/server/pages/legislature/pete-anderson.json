How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"Born in Great Falls MT, 29 years old, permanent resident of Great Falls, owner of Botti Builders LLC and the MICA Montana Independent Contractor Alliance, CMR High School graduate and BA from MSU Bozeman. As a lifelong Montana resident and Great Falls born and raised I have more in common with the average Montanan than any out of state politician or disproportionately wealthy individual. My experiences as a small business owner and traditional family man have shaped my conservative ideology, however in those roles I am pragmatic in order to bring different ideologies together to resolve conflicts and get the job done. At the end of the day we are all Montanans and we want to continue to enjoy the freedoms and quality of living we deserve."},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"The most pressing issues for most Montanans include the rising cost of housing, economic instability, and community safety. To move forward I would propose or support legislation to put limits on the increase or decrease of property taxes, as well as exploring ways to tax property that provides an incentive to build more housing (high land tax, low house tax). I also would support legislation to lower the taxes on small local businesses. In order to grow our economy I think Montana needs to be consuming more of the product it produces, and our young adults need another option after high school in the form of trade and vocational apprenticeships. As new a father of two, I also support keeping communities safe and the ability to self defend."},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"I think local services are very important, but the property taxes are chasing the appraisal value and not the financial demand of those services. What would it look like if we calculated property tax in a different way, and what if we had a number to look at for government services instead of just letting them use whatever budget happens to come together? I think Montana is starting to grow exponentially as one of the last strongholds of true American values in the country, we must be careful and protect the longstanding Montana residents by being priced out by the affluent newcomers. This happens to every tourist economy. We should prioritize keeping costs low for Montana residents and increase costs for newcomers and affluent investors."},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"I think we should figure out what the costs of such services would be to provide care for all deserving Montanans that cannot afford private Healthcare. I wonder why these costs are never figured out first and why we pass legislation and figure out what it costs later. The way things should work is that we calculate the max revenue that can be generated through fair tax, and then allocate the funding to all programs needed for Montana to function. If the numbers aren't enough then we have to look at ways to tax. Government should be run like a business that represents the citizens, it should be invested in the best benefits for the people at the lowest cost to them and their freedoms. "},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"I think Montana teachers should have ratings that are based on student enjoyment, participation, and other indicators of their efficacy as an educator. Each rating should have significant pay increase as an incentive to be a super educator who is liked by students, parents, and staff. High schools and Universities should have basic and equal allocation for extra curricular activities, but extraordinary development like building a state of the art gym or art studio should come from external income like donations, ticket sales, and specific grants. Shop classes and vocational programs should be hiring out their students to local businesses to fill the labor gap and provide more income for school. It all goes back to thinking more profitably."}]},"coverage":[],"primaryResults":{"race":"HD-23","party":"R","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"ERIC TILLEMAN","party":"R","votes":820,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":0.6096654275092936},{"candidate":"PETE ANDERSON","party":"R","votes":293,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.2178438661710037},{"candidate":"JOHN H  PROUD","party":"R","votes":184,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.13680297397769517},{"candidate":"JOSH DENULLY","party":"R","votes":48,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.035687732342007436}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:41 PM"},"opponents":[{"slug":"eric-tilleman","displayName":"ERIC TILLEMAN","summaryLine":null,"party":"R"},{"slug":"sandor-r-hopkins","displayName":"SANDOR R HOPKINS","summaryLine":null,"party":"D"},{"slug":"kevin-leatherbarrow","displayName":"KEVIN LEATHERBARROW","summaryLine":null,"party":"L"}]},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
