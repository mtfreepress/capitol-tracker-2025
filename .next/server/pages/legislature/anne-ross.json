How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"Born and living in Billings, MT, I'm a 39 year old mom to two young children and also a self-employed artist and property manager. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Fine Arts, and I've completed the equivalent to a Bachelor's in Science in Psychology from Montana State University Bozeman. I worked as a Care Manager at Youth Dynamics and as the Director of Operations for a large spa company. I have skills in navigating difficult conversations, finding people's needs, and collaborating on meaningful solutions. Short on time, I prioritize tasks to advance my goals while also tending to the day-to-day needs of my kids. I work well under pressure and am committed to serving the greater good, particularly for marginalized and underrepresented groups."},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"Montana's democracy and personal freedoms are being attacked by a powerful few. I will fight for policies protecting our rights regarding medical privacy, bodily autonomy and worker's union rights. Our current property tax system unconstitutionally burdens lower income Montanans, and I propose shifting this burden back to the ultra-wealthy and large corporations. Additionally, I'll advocate for the enhancement of Medicaid, which supports low and middle income Montanans, including many indigenous people and children, and helps our rural economies with jobs in health care. Our public schools also need proper funding and fair teacher salaries; I am committed to fully supporting them and resisting the shift of funds to private charter schools."},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"Our Montana property tax system has become increasingly and unconstitutionally hard on low-to-middle-income Montana residents while providing tax cuts to large corporations and the ultra-rich. The solution is straightforward: shift the tax burden back to the groups with the largest amount of resources and influence. Currently, residential properties are taxed based on market value, whereas industrial properties owned by refineries, railroads, and telecom companies are assessed differently. This discrepancy unfairly benefits these corporations, allowing them to contribute less than their fair share. Adjusting this imbalance will make the tax system more equitable, and replenish our state fund which supports essential services for Montanans."},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"Medicaid expansion, 90% funded by the federal government, has helped rural Montana hospitals and care facilities stay open through recent economic and pandemic related setbacks. We have invested in the expansion of services due to the cost savings and bolstered our economy with good paying jobs around the state. Medicaid expansion will end in 2025 unless our elected officials renew it. We need more long-term care facilities for mental health and the aging community through additional expenditures, which are made possible by the consistent annual influx of over $900million in federal funds. Patients benefit from remaining close to their families and communities, and our aging population will be needing a lot more care in the coming decades."},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"The funding challenges are connected to the shift of the tax burden from large corporations and the ultra-rich to workers and families who simply have less money to pull from. This has had a direct impact on resources available to fund schools. We must realign the tax system to ensure fairness. Additionally, removing the 3% cap on inflationary budget increases is crucial. This allows budget adjustments to accurately reflect actual inflation rates, which were as high as 8% in recent years. Furthermore, there's a pressing need to increase state funding for special education programs, and to stop the steal of school funding by siphoning money to private charter schools who are not required to educate students needing specific interventions."}]},"coverage":[],"primaryResults":{"race":"HD-48","party":"D","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"ANNE ROSS","party":"D","votes":680,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":1}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:41 PM"},"opponents":[{"slug":"curtis-schomer","displayName":"CURTIS SCHOMER","summaryLine":null,"party":"R"},{"slug":"anne-ross","displayName":"ANNE ROSS","summaryLine":null,"party":"D"}]},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
