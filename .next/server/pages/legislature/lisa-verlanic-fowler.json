How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"I am 55 years old, I was born in Butte, MT and was raised in Anaconda MT. I have lived in Missoula, MT since 1987. I have been a primary school teacher in Florence, MT for the past 30 years, with a masters degree in education. My job as a teacher requires me to be a good listener, be a problem solver and treat all people with respect. In addition to my educator duties, I am currently the president of my local union, I have served on the negotiations committee and I was the chair of our Child Assistance Team. I believe my ability to work effectively with people in a wide variety of situations qualifies me to be an effective legislator. As a life-long MT resident, I am invested in our state with my whole heart. This is my forever home."},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"The believe the most pressing issue for the 2025 legislative session is the reality that many Montanans can't afford to live in our beautiful state. As a legislator, I would propose and support legislation that requires all MT residents to pay their fair share of taxes and state government is held accountable for how our tax dollars are being spent. The money our state collects in taxes must be spent wisely. As legislators, we must not pass laws that are unconditional or have unconditional elements that send us down the path of litigation. Dollars spent on legal fees should instead be allocated for increase in salaries for our law enforcement officers, fire fighters and to support our veterans along with lowering property taxes. "},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"I believe we have to make changes on how Montana funds public schools to help decrease our property taxes. The Montana Constitution guarantees that all students receive a fair and quality public education. The basic entitlement for all schools needs to be increased by using state funds. While the push for charter schools may increase opportunities for some students, inevitably our state will not be able to adequately support our public schools. With increased state funding, schools won't need to run levies, therefore reducing the tax liability of our residents. I believe a primary residence should be taxed at 75% of the assessed value. We should encourage more film making in MT and negotiate a portion of proceeds to fund the tax base."},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"A healthy Montana is a great Montana. Health care access should not be a privilege but a right for all Montana residents, regardless of their financial status. I believe the legislature and other government leaders should work together to ensure our residents can access medical care through ride share vouchers to clinics, offer incentives to healthcare providers for working in the most rural parts of our state, especially our reservations, and help with getting medications at a lower cost. We need to hire more health care advocates that also provide information and support on how to live a healthy lifestyle. "},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"A public school education is the greatest equalizer we have. The Montana school funding formula needs to be changed. As an educator for the past 30 years in a K-12 school, I have witnessed first-hand the repercussions of inadequate school funding. As I mentioned before, we need to ensure all Montana residents are paying their fair share of taxes. We need to eliminate unnecessary spending of our tax dollars. I believe we should research the idea of a state wide salary schedule for educators to attract quality applicants.  Furthermore, the state needs to institute a policy that they will reimburse the cost of a grant writer for each school (K-12, college/universities and vocation education program).

The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
