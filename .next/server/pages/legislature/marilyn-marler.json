How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"I will be 54 on election day. I’ve lived in Missoula for 30 years after moving here to attend graduate school, meeting my husband, and staying gainfully employed while also being an active member of our community. I was born a long time ago in Lynwood, California. At a young age our family moved to rural central California where I attended public schools, the local community college and then transferred to UC Davis to get a BS in biology. I came to Missoula to get an MS in biology, focusing on spotted knapweed biology. Now my job is managing UM’s natural areas. I have served 3 terms in the state legislature and before that I served 3 elected terms on the Missoula City Council, including serving as Council President. \nAll of these experience"},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"Medicaid expansion is one, since it will go away without action from the state legislature. I will support continuing Medicaid expansion.\nAccess to reproductive health care is another, since our current state administration is committed to outlawing not just abortion, but fertility treatments and birth control. I will always vote in support of a women’s right to control their own body, health care and family planning.\n\nHousing is another pressing issue, and I think the government can play a role in making housing more affordable. Solutions range from zoning changes to subsidizing or underwriting affordable housing projects with loans, grants or other incentives. It is clear that “the market” is not going to correct itself any time soon.\n"},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"A lot of our property taxes go towards local roads and schools. The state could help alleviate property taxes by paying more of the cost for local schools and roads. Most people had their property taxes increased this year due to the GOP administration failing to reduce that tax rate (despite their own Department of Revenue advising them to do so). Yet our local schools are still struggling, resulting in an emergency for local taxpayers. The state government needs to listen to local governments and taxpayers and invest in the basics we all value, like good public schools and roads. Another example of the state not listening to local taxpayers is when Missoula County adopted, by popular vote, a local 2 cent gas tax, as a way to alleviate pro"},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"We clearly need to continue Medicaid Expansion and increase provider rates so that health professionals can offer needed services. We should also increase funding for crisis intervention teams who can help when a person needs more than a police response. Investing in housing is important too."},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"We have money for these education programs. The problem is that extremists in the state government are re-directing taxpayer funds to private religious schools while also failing to make adequate budgets for schools. The school funding formula is complex and I support adjustments that will allow pay increases for teachers, maintenance of school buildings, and having the state pay a fair share of these expenses instead of passing them off to property taxes."}]},"coverage":[],"primaryResults":{"race":"HD-94","party":"D","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"MARILYN MARLER","party":"D","votes":1865,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":1}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:41 PM"},"opponents":[{"slug":"marilyn-marler","displayName":"MARILYN MARLER","summaryLine":null,"party":"D"},{"slug":"adam-s-henson","displayName":"ADAM S HENSON","summaryLine":null,"party":"R"}]},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
