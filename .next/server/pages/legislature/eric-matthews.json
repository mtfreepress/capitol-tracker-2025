How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?","answer":"Born and live in Bozeman Montana. I will be 50 on election day 2024. 25 year teacher. I work for Bozeman Public Schools. I have a bachelors in elementary education and a masters in science and science education.\nMy career as an educator has led me to doing union work for Bozeman educators, and I have also stepped up to represent our state level public employee union as a vice president. Through this work I have seen the need to work for and protect the middle class by pushing for fair wages, healthcare, retirement with dignity, and safe working conditions. I think that it is also beneficial to representing the district that I was born in, graduated high school in, got my first job in, etc. I know my community and I am a proud of it."},{"question":"What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?","answer":"Property taxes, education funding and medicaid expansion. Property taxes are part of a fair tax system that works for every Montanan. The legislature along with the governor need to use the tools at our disposal to adjust tax rates so corporations pay their share. Education funding is a disaster. We need to include a cost of living allowance into our formula for districts that are in high cost of living communities in Montana. Medicaid expansion is necessary for many reasons including keeping access to healthcare in our rural areas. The work is in process and I will be supporting it in every way I can."},{"question":"Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?","answer":"I would absolutely support changes to our tax system to help working Montanans find relief with property taxes. 3 things that I would support are equalizing property taxes to shift the 11% increase on residential back to highly profitable corporations in Montana. I would support a homestead exemption so primary homes are taxed at a lower rate. I would also push to bring the tax rate for high income earners back up to the level it was before the 2023 session. All of these options together would bring tax relief for home owners in Montana."},{"question":"Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?","answer":"Medicaid expansion is a primary focus this next session. We must lift the sunset on the program so we can continue to support healthcare across our state. We started a 300,000 program for mental health and we need to make sure we see that work through and see that the people that need help are getting it. I think we need to also do a better job providing for the healthcare of our youngest citizens. No child should be without healthcare! I will support any legislation that strengthens our system for all Montanans. "},{"question":"Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?","answer":"I believe that we are not currently funding education as our constitution demands. The concept of quality education has been manipulated to leave us with a system that is struggling to meet the basic needs of our students. The cost of living in MT has changed over the years and the difference in cost of living across the state is now disparate. The school funding formula has no way to account for that and it is past time to do so. In addition, the cap on inflationary increase for school funding has effectively caused education funding to fall farther and farther behind! We must fix both of these problems in the next session."}]},"coverage":[],"primaryResults":{"race":"HD-66","party":"D","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"ERIC MATTHEWS","party":"D","votes":1576,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":1}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:41 PM"},"opponents":[{"slug":"eric-matthews","displayName":"ERIC MATTHEWS","summaryLine":null,"party":"D"},{"slug":"marla-davis","displayName":"MARLA DAVIS","summaryLine":null,"party":"R"}]},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
