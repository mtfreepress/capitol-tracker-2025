He describes himself as a veteran and a “regular Montanan” who understands how commissioners’ work affects the day-to-day lives of the people they serve. \n\n“I'm not a lawyer, and I'm not a legislator up against term limits. I live and work here and understand the impact of rate hikes, telecommunications quality and availability,” he said.\n\nElwood told MTFP he considers limited access to cell phone coverage and internet in parts of eastern Montana a “travesty” he would like to fix. He also said he is passionate about railroad safety. He said his remote work with health care provider Altera as an interface analyst has familiarized him with the sort of specialized, complex work he would enjoy doing as a commissioner. He added that serving if elected, serving on the PSC would be his full-time job.\n\n“I'm environmentally conscious, as are most people who live and work around the agricultural industry, but I approach it from a reasonable point of view,” Elwood said. \n\nThis biography is based on an MTFP interview with Elwood and his response to an MTFP questionnaire.\n","party":"R","isIncumbent":false,"status":"lost-primary","fecId":null,"campaignWebsite":null,"campaignFB":null,"campaignTW":null,"campaignIG":null,"campaignYT":null,"campaignTT":null,"raceSlug":"psc-3","raceDisplayName":"Public Service Commission (Seat 3)","opponents":[{"slug":"jeff-welborn","displayName":"Jeff Welborn","summaryLine":"State senator","party":"R"},{"slug":"leonard-williams","displayName":"Leonard Williams","summaryLine":"Butte electrician and labor organizer","party":"D"}],"coverage":[{"title":"The GOP-heavy primary for Montana’s utility-regulating PSC","date":"2024-05-21T12:41:21","link":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/05/21/the-gop-heavy-primary-for-montanas-utility-regulating-psc/","tags":["2023 Legislature","2024 election Guide","2024 elections","Brad Molnar","Jeff Welborn","Kirk Bushman","Public Service Commission","Rob Elwood","Suzzann Nordwick"],"categories":["2024 Elections"],"featuredImage":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/05/21/the-gop-heavy-primary-for-montanas-utility-regulating-psc/psc/","author":"Amanda Eggert"}],"finance":null,"questionnaire":{"hasResponses":true,"responses":[{"question":"Regulatory matters under the PSC’s jurisdiction are often highly specialized and complex. Please describe your qualifications for performing the technical aspects of the commission's work.","answer":"The PSC is here to regulate business and industry that is complex by nature and extremely specialized. My technical background in my career has also been extremely specialized and complex, and I enjoy that aspect of the work. \n\n"},{"question":"To what extent do you regard climate change as an issue that needs to be addressed by the PSC? What if any actions regarding climate change do you think it’s appropriate for the PSC to consider?","answer":"The PSC regulates according to legislation that is in place and really needs to be active in working with the Legislature in legislation that deals with environmental issues. The PSC is not there to regulate based on the personal opinions of the commissioners. In fact, the PSC has gotten into trouble in the past by regulating loosely, or not at all, when some commissioners don't like the legislation that is in place. It is not up to the PSC to decide what legislation they like. Their job is to regulate based on the legislation that is in place.\n\n"},{"question":"Montana’s energy grid is facing a major transition as coal plants are taken offline. How should the PSC manage customer affordability and grid reliability as that transition takes place?","answer":"Montana is behind in implementing \"smart\" metering that will allow different rates at different times of the day, or days of the week. They are being rolled out now. Technology is the answer, and encouraging customers to use power in the off-peak demand times will help significantly. Using gas that is now flared to run microgenerators will help. New generation such as geothermal, nuclear and micro-hydroelectric generators need to be evaluated and rolled into the energy mix.\n\n"},{"question":"What if any specific actions should be taken by the PSC to reduce Montana consumers’ power bills?","answer":"First, rate hikes need to be reasonable, only allowed if absolutely required, and the absolute minimum necessary. Net metering needs to be made easy when Montana residents want to implement some form of power generation at their home or business. \n\n"},{"question":"What other issues within the PSC’s domain would you prioritize as a commissioner? What specific actions would you encourage regarding those issues?","answer":"Railroad safety is an area where Montana has some unique requirements. Technology can help tremendously at uncontrolled crossings as well as with roadbed quality issues. Temperature extremes and bad weather make railroad safety more of a challenge here, but we can use technology to overcome some of these challenges. The PSC needs to work with the Legislature and the railroads to use technology to do that.\n"}]},"primaryResults":{"race":"psc-3","raceDisplayName":"Public Service Commission (Seat 3)","party":"R","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"JEFF WELBORN","party":"R","votes":13291,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":0.39459074310483033},{"candidate":"SUZZANN NORDWICK","party":"R","votes":13047,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.387346732773209},{"candidate":"ROB ELWOOD","party":"R","votes":7345,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.21806252412196064}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:48 PM"}},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
