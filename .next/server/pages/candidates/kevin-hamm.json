state’s utility regulation board, in 2022.\n\nAs he campaigns this year, Hamm says he felt like he needed to step up and run for office in order to stand up to “greedy extremists” who have made “vitriol and hate” a normal part of political discourse.\n\n“The direction of the country is out of line with the goals of the citizenry,” he said.\n\nThis biography is based on written materials submitted by Hamm as well as past MTFP reporting.\n","party":"D","isIncumbent":false,"status":"lost-primary","fecId":"H4MT02031","campaignWebsite":null,"campaignFB":null,"campaignTW":null,"campaignIG":null,"campaignYT":null,"campaignTT":null,"raceSlug":"us-house-2","raceDisplayName":"U.S.

do you regard as the biggest issue Montana is facing that Congress is in a position to address? How would you address it if elected or re-elected?","answer":"Protecting democracy and our right to vote our leaders into office. Immediately followed by fair taxation/no inflation. Corporations and the ultra-wealthy must be required to pay their fair share. In many cases, as an example, corporations are a greater burden on our publicly-funded infrastructure and paying a fair share is the American way. Fair tax policy will lift some of the burden on individuals and families and place large corporations in a tax bracket that is more reflective of their heavier use of public infrastructure than the average citizen. \n\n"},{"question":"Can you name a current member of Congress you admire? What do respect about them?","answer":"Jasmine Crockett of Texas. There are very few people in Congress, current and past, that I truly admire, but more and more I’m seeing people my age and younger who are bringing fire to the firefight and making a difference, and Rep. Crockett is a star. Her wit, her cadence, her style and her inability to tolerate fools is something we need. She’s sharp and well-informed, ready and willing to do the work but will call out unacceptable idiocy in open conversation. There are no smoke and mirrors on her watch. I look forward to working with her.\n\n"},{"question":"If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a congressman?","answer":"The American Rescue Plan and the Infrastructure Plan already passed by the Biden administration are good blueprints for what we need to do next. We need to, and President Biden has asked for, an expansion of the child tax credit. We can invest in first-time home buying programs, microgeneration of electricity and regulate fair sale rates back to the grid. We can expand our infrastructure investments to massively expand broadband, high-speed rail, airport, sea ports and shipping infrastructure. We can advance the goals of clean air, clean water, manage wildlife and expand our public lands, and still have businesses making money and growing our economy. We need to remind investors that investing in the tech for wind and solar will pay off both monetarily and socially in the future. And while I agree with many Biden policies, I don’t agree 100% of the time, and I’d work with the administration as much as possible to make sure that where we don’t agree we also do no harm.\n\n"},{"question":"Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?","answer":"I make no bones about the fact that I disagree with Mr. Trump on far more items than I agree with him, but that doesn’t mean it’s 100%, and just like with President Biden, I’d work to make sure that where we disagree we do no harm, and where we agree we work together to improve the lives of all Americans. \n\n"},{"question":"Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?","answer":"I would aim to drive economic growth, create fair taxation and establish fair compensation rules to reduce the federal deficit. We should be investing in education as the fastest way out of the deficit is innovations.\n\nFair taxation/No inflation. Corporations and the ultra-wealthy must be required to pay their fair share. Fair tax policy will lift some of the burden on individuals and families. \n\nFair compensation. Over the last five decades the playing field has tilted wildly in favor of the few ultra-wealthy and it’s time to level the playing field. We need to cap executive pay in relation to the pay of frontline workers. And, unions are the fastest way to regular wage increases so get a union.\n\nEconomic growth. Montana is the #1 state for entrepreneurs. We have a long, proud history of being hard workers and smart creators. We have the space to build things, including more housing, and transport things manufactured as we have the routes to distribute them.\n\n"},{"question":"Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortion access or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?","answer":"I would support federal legislation that guarantees that all women will have access to health care, including abortion, on a national basis. It’s 2024 and I can’t believe we’re having to explain this to a whole national party, but women are human and deserve full human rights.\n\n"},{"question":"What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?","answer":"Making sure that first-time buyers have access to loans at good interest rates is important, and that we are investing money into growing communities to expand their housing inventory. That also means making sure that the majority of housing is available to homebuyers as opposed to private equity and for investment purposes so we’re reasonably ensuring housing availability for families without being in competition with for-profit operations. The credit score regulations are stacked against people, especially those in their 20s and 30s. We need to adjust the regulations on credit scores so rental history counts towards your ability to qualify for a loan, and not using a credit card has a positive impact on your score rather than impacting your score negatively. \nAdditionally, reducing the wage gap at every business will improve things for everyone, while fighting greedflation and the price gouging that’s currently driving up the costs of living for everyone will help.\n\n"},{"question":"To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?","answer":"Science says we have 10 years. We’ve all watched as winters have gotten warmer and less snow has fallen. In Montana we have the constitutional right to a clean and healthy environment. We that enshrined for every U.S. citizen. In Montana we have a deep love for our outdoor heritage. We can take advantage of our healthful environment, by encouraging active family lifestyles via walkable communities, which would also reduce the emissions that threaten the landscapes we love. Public lands are a precious resource as land availability is finite. To maintain open spaces we should encourage the creation of community development with smart density population growth rather than disconnected suburban sprawl. Addressing climate change is also a necessity for the rural livelihood of our farmers and ranchers because sudden and/or extreme weather events caused by climate change can devastate crops and significantly change the care needed (and cost involved) in raising crops to a successful harvest.\n\n"},{"question":"What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?","answer":"The security needed at our southern border is, in part, a symptom of immigration laws that are too complicated. The immigration system needs to be improved upon significantly and treating people with humanity should not take a backseat to any other interest. Reducing the over-adversarial stance of our immigration policy, combined with funding the research and investigative arms, will mean faster ways for good people to move here, which will ultimately help us grow.\n\nNone of this happens without the funding and authorization to do so, and that comes from Congress getting its act together and actually passing comprehensive border reform. We can do this. It takes time and dedication and elected officials who are interested in finding solutions. It takes someone like me, a fighter who knows when not to fight.\n"},{"question":"The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?","answer":"Health literally equates to wealth so the healthier we are as a country, the wealthier we will all be and our overall economy will be stronger as well. Medicare should be expanded to everyone as a public option, and Medicare and Medicaid must be allowed, like all other health care insurers, to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies on the costs of treatments. We’ve seen lives improve when people have access to affordable, quality health care. Healthy people stay healthy because they aren’t afraid a regular check-up is going to bankrupt them. Healthy people with access to preventative care are also able to focus their energy on careers and business ideas, rather than struggling to be well. It’s well past time that we all agree that making sure someone can see a doctor when a little issue arises without fear of losing their jobs or facing bankruptcy, is better than having someone wait till they need to hit the ER for help.\n"}]},"primaryResults":{"race":"us-house-2","raceDisplayName":"U.S. House District 2 (East)","party":"D","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"JOHN B DRISCOLL","party":"D","votes":13317,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":0.3331165420116567},{"candidate":"STEVE HELD","party":"D","votes":10583,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.2647272181504365},{"candidate":"MING CABRERA","party":"D","votes":8341,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.2086449708582435},{"candidate":"KEVIN HAMM","party":"D","votes":7736,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.1935112689796633}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:48 PM"}},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
