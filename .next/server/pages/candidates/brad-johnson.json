He says he believes in reducing federal spending, reinstating the Trump-era “remain in Mexico” policy and opposing government efforts at combating climate change. \n\nHe’s positioned himself as a grassroots alternative to Sheehy and has accused national Republicans of attempting to manufacture the outcome of the primary following Congressman Matt Rosendale’s termination of his campaign. \n\nAs former secretary of state and chairman of the Public Service Commission, I have proven electability and a real record for Montanans to judge,” Johnson wrote in [a recent opinion column](https://missoulian.com/opinion/column/brad-johnson-election-interference-is-on-full-display-in-montana/article_a428de2e-d7fe-11ee-a5bf-2bc5ea1b1a77.html). “Mr. Sheehy has neither. Mitch McConnell and Steve Daines need to get their thumbs off the scale and let Montana Republicans choose their Senate candidate without further outside interference from The Swamp.”\n\nThis biography is based on material Johnson provided to MTFP as well as prior MTFP coverage of his campaign.\n","party":"R","isIncumbent":false,"status":"lost-primary","fecId":"S2MT00062","campaignWebsite":null,"campaignFB":null,"campaignTW":null,"campaignIG":null,"campaignYT":null,"campaignTT":null,"raceSlug":"us-senate","raceDisplayName":"U.S. Senate","opponents":[{"slug":"jon-tester","displayName":"Jon Tester","summaryLine":"Incumbent U.S. senator","party":"D"},{"slug":"tim-sheehy","displayName":"Tim Sheehy","summaryLine":"Bozeman businessman","party":"R"},{"slug":"sid-daoud","displayName":"Sid Daoud","summaryLine":"Kalispell city councilman","party":"L"},{"slug":"robert-barb","displayName":"Robert Barb","summaryLine":"Billings resident","party":"G"}],"coverage":[{"title":"First-quarter fundraising numbers shape federal campaigns","date":"2024-04-19T13:15:52","link":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/04/19/tester-first-quarter-fundraising-more-than-double-sheehys/","tags":["2024 election Guide","2024 elections","Brad Johnson","Denny Rehberg","Elsie Arntzen","federal election commission","John Driscoll","Jon Tester","Kevin Hamm","Mary Todd","ming cabrera","Monica Tranel","Ryan Zinke","Steve Held","Tim Sheehy","Troy Downing"],"categories":["2024 Elections"],"featuredImage":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/04/19/tester-first-quarter-fundraising-more-than-double-sheehys/untitled-design-676/","author":"Arren Kimbel-Sannit"}],"finance":[{"displayName":"Jon Tester","party":"D","candidateCommitteeName":"MONTANANS FOR TESTER","candidateId":"S6MT00162","totalReceipts":43775556.22,"totalDisbursments":33373881.22,"cashOnHand":10882248.87,"coverageEndDate":"2024-06-30","isThisCandidate":false,"candidateStatus":"active"},{"displayName":"Tim Sheehy","party":"R","candidateCommitteeName":"TIM SHEEHY FOR MONTANA","candidateId":"S4MT00183","totalReceipts":14065647.85,"totalDisbursments":10795081.65,"cashOnHand":3270566.2,"coverageEndDate":"2024-06-30","isThisCandidate":false,"candidateStatus":"active"},{"displayName":"Brad Johnson","party":"R","candidateCommitteeName":"BRAD FOR MONTANA","candidateId":"S2MT00062","totalReceipts":43094,"totalDisbursments":43094,"cashOnHand":0,"coverageEndDate":"2024-06-30","isThisCandidate":true,"candidateStatus":"lost-primary"},{"displayName":"Charles Walkingchild","party":"R","candidateCommitteeName":"CHARLES WALKINGCHILD","candidateId":"S4MT00209","totalReceipts":0,"totalDisbursments":0,"cashOnHand":0,"coverageEndDate":null,"isThisCandidate":false,"candidateStatus":"lost-primary"}],"questionnaire":{"hasResponses":true,"responses":[{"question":"What do you see as the biggest issue Montana is facing that the Senate is in a position to address? How would you address it if elected or re-elected?","answer":"There are many, but the most pressing for all fifty states is the border crisis. I will work tirelessly to codify the key elements of the Trump border policies. Finishing the wall, reinstating the \"stay in Mexico\"  policy, ending \"catch and release\" and deporting as many illegal aliens as reasonably possible should all be made a matter of law.\n\n"},{"question":"If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a senator?","answer":"President Biden and I agree on virtually nothing when it comes to public policy. I see it as my responsibility as a senator to do everything I can to minimize the damage being done by the extreme progressive policies he is attempting to advance.\n\n"},{"question":"Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?","answer":"Conversely, I agree with the vast majority of former President Trump's public policy positions. I will be completely committed to building alliances with my colleagues for the purpose of realizing those policy goals.\n\n"},{"question":"Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?","answer":"We simply cannot spend America rich and federal spending must be brought under control. There are a number of things that should be done to accomplish that. Moving to zero based budgeting, eliminating continuing resolutions and omnibus budget bills, defunding several departments including Education, Energy and Commerce and passing a Balanced Budget  Amendment are among them. However, if we were to do away with all of the discretionary spending in the budget today, it would not be enough to bring it into balance. I will strive to be a catalyst for meaningful discussions regarding the reform of entitlement programs so that we can preserve  them for future generations in a fiscally responsible manner. There is, in my mind, absolutely no justification for any new taxes and I will oppose any attempt to levy them.\n\n"},{"question":"Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortions or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?","answer":"For 50 years I argued that Rowe was bad law because abortion policy should be determined by the states. I still believe that. I am staunchly pro-life and would be supportive of state legislation restricting abortion but including exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.\n\n"},{"question":"What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?","answer":"This is another issue that rightly resides with the states. Nowhere in the Constitution does it give the federal government the power to become a real-estate developer or landlord.\n\n"},{"question":"To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?","answer":"The climate has always been and is today in flux. However, that change does not present an existential threat to our future. The hysteria surrounding the debate and the knee-jerk reactions that hysteria brings poses a far greater threat. The draconian \"solutions\" proposed in the \"green new deal\" and by this EPA are impossible to achieve and would cripple our economy. Private sector innovation and market forces will continue to lead us to attainable, sustainable and cleaner energy sources.\n\n"},{"question":"What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?","answer":"I will work tirelessly to codify the key elements of the Trump border policies. Finishing the wall, reinstating the “stay in Mexico” policy, ending “catch and release” and deporting as many illegal aliens as reasonably possible should all be made a matter of law.\n\n"},{"question":"The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?","answer":"We should return to a market-based health insurance system with the addition of a means tested voucher system to assist those individuals and families who genuinely need the help.\n\n"},{"question":"Under what if any circumstances do you believe the U.S. should be providing military support to parties involved in foreign conflicts?","answer":"First and foremost, military aid should be provided to another country only when a clear national interest has been identified. And then, that aid should be forthcoming only after we have assurances that there will be meaningful transparency and accountability regarding the use of the resources provided.\n"}]},"primaryResults":{"race":"us-senate","raceDisplayName":"U.S. Senate","party":"R","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"TIM SHEEHY","party":"R","votes":138202,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":0.7363115693012601},{"candidate":"BRAD JOHNSON","party":"R","votes":36460,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.1942513119688857},{"candidate":"CHARLES WALKINGCHILD SR","party":"R","votes":13033,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.06943711872985428}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:48 PM"}},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
