{"pageProps":{"pageData":{"slug":"troy-downing","displayName":"Troy Downing","lastName":"Downing","summaryLine":"State auditor","summaryNarrative":"Downing, 57, is the state’s current state auditor and commissioner of securities and insurance. He has previously worked in the technology, insurance and real estate industries.\n\nDowning grew up in California but has had a home in Montana since 1998. He says he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard after the September 11 terrorist attacks and served two tours of duty in Afghanistan.\n\nAlthough Downing has spent much of his time in Montana living in the state’s western congressional district — places like Gallatin Gateway and Big Sky — he lives in Helena in his capacity as a state official. \n\nDowning has served as Montana’s state auditor, or securities and insurance commissioner, since 2021. He chose to make a bid for Congress this year instead of pursuing a second four-year term in that role.\n\nIn public statements about his candidacy, Downing has focused on concerns about the southern border and inflation. He has also touted his business and military experience.\n\n“I think that’s what voters want,” he [told MTN News](https://www.ktvh.com/replacing-rosendale/troy-downing-republican-candidate-for-montanas-eastern-u-s-house-seat) in an interview published in May. “They want somebody who is going to show up, roll up their sleeves, do the work — that understands what it’s like to build a business, understand what it’s like to go to war, understands what it’s like to sign the front of a payroll check.\n\nDowning [pleaded guilty in 2018](https://helenair.com/news/state-regional/govt-and-politics/former-us-senate-candidate-acknowledges-hunting-violations/article_3523a095-5b50-5da2-a616-039c370fc8df.html?gv=1) to two misdemeanor charges of obtaining resident hunting licenses for several years while not officially a Montana resident. At the time, Downing argued the matter was the result of his accountants preparing tax forms that listed him as a California resident. According to the Bozeman Daily Chronicle, he was ordered to pay a $2,110 fine and forego hunting and fishing privileges for 18 months. \n\nDowning’s campaign declined to provide responses for MTFP’s spring 2024 candidate questionnaire.

Gazette](https://billingsgazette.com/news/local/troy-downing-congress-house-montana-eastern-district/article_e53d7606-f1fb-11ee-85b2-4798069cd1b9.html) and [MTN

The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
