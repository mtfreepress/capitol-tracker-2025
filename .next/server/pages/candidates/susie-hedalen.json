She obtained a bachelor’s and a master’s degree from Montana State University, both in the education field, and is currently the superintendent of the Townsend public schools, where she lives with her husband.\n\nA graduate of Helena High School, Hedalen characterizes herself as a “product of Montana’s public school system” and describes a long list of professional certifications and credentials. She previously served as deputy to the current state superintendent, Republican Elsie Arntzen, and her campaign has so far focused on various state-level issues including parental rights, tribal collaboration and the enhancement of career and technical education.\n\n“I am running for state superintendent to get education back to basics, put parents and students first, and keep our schools safe,” Hedalen said.\n\nThis biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by Hedalen’s campaign via a written questionnaire as well as prior MTFP reporting.\n","party":"R","isIncumbent":false,"status":"active","fecId":null,"campaignWebsite":"https://www.susieforschools.com/","campaignFB":"https://www.facebook.com/Susie-for-Schools-100094601234443/","campaignTW":null,"campaignIG":"https://www.instagram.com/susieforschools/","campaignYT":null,"campaignTT":null,"raceSlug":"superintendent","raceDisplayName":"Superintendent of Public Instruction","opponents":[{"slug":"susie-hedalen","displayName":"Susie Hedalen","summaryLine":"Townsend School District superintendent","party":"R"},{"slug":"shannon-obrien","displayName":"Shannon O'Brien","summaryLine":"State senator","party":"D"}],"coverage":[{"title":"Susie Hedalen claims victory in Republican superintendent primary","date":"2024-06-05T09:32:03","link":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/06/05/susie-hedalen-claims-victory-in-republican-superintendent-primary/","tags":["2024 election Guide","2024 elections","Shannon O’Brien","Susie Hedalen"],"categories":["2024 Elections"],"featuredImage":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/06/05/susie-hedalen-claims-victory-in-republican-superintendent-primary/untitled-design-96-2/","author":"Alex Sakariassen"},{"title":"What state superintendent candidates are saying about school funding","date":"2024-05-23T16:54:11","link":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/05/23/what-montana-state-superintendent-candidates-saying-about-school-funding/","tags":["2024 election Guide","Shannon O’Brien","Sharyl Allen","Susie Hedalen"],"categories":["2024 Elections"],"featuredImage":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/05/23/what-montana-state-superintendent-candidates-saying-about-school-funding/spi/","author":"Eric Dietrich"},{"title":"Lining up to lead OPI","date":"2023-07-28T16:26:52","link":"https://montanafreepress.org/2023/07/28/candidates-line-up-to-lead-montana-office-public-instruction/","tags":["2024 election Guide","Austin Knudsen","Elsie Arntzen","Greg Gianforte","Office of Public Instruction","Shannon O’Brien","Sharyl Allen","Susie Hedalen"],"categories":["2024 Elections"],"featuredImage":"https://montanafreepress.org/2022/07/21/montana-teacher-license-revenue-redirect/untitled-design-122/","author":"Alex Sakariassen"}],"finance":null,"questionnaire":{"hasResponses":true,"responses":[{"question":"What do you regard as the most pressing issue facing Montana’s education system?","answer":"I am running to get education back to basics, put parents and students first, and keep our schools safe. These are the most pressing issues before our education system. If you look at our state report card, less than half of students are proficient in reading, writing, and math, yet we spend a record of $13,000+ per student per year. As state superintendent, I will prioritize academic outcomes in core subjects for students and expand career and technical education. I will support professional development for educators, improve customer service from OPI, reduce state administrative burdens on schools, and remain accountable when schools fall short. By focusing our resources on student learning, we can get more funding directly to the classroom and families where it belongs and, in turn, improve student outcomes. Additionally, safe schools and parent engagement are critical to student success. \n\n"},{"question":"Do you believe changes to Montana’s school finance system are necessary to ensure locally administered school districts have the funding they need to meet their constitutional obligation to provide students with a quality education? What if any changes would you advocate for over the next four years as state superintendent?","answer":"Montana’s school funding formula has not been critically studied in a decade. Next year, state education leaders and legislators will begin a new study of the school funding formula. As state superintendent, I plan to play a substantial role in examining what is working and what is not working in how we fund education. We must ensure that school funding directly supports students and makes its way to classrooms while minimizing administrative costs. This will allow education dollars to stretch further and put the focus where it should be: educating students.\n\n"},{"question":"Education policies have become increasingly politicized in recent years. How can state policy help Montana’s public schools balance the diverse ideologies and worldviews of the families they serve?","answer":"As a teacher and school administrator, I know how vital family engagement and respect for family values are to student success. I have collaborated with families for my entire career. By focusing on the fundamental building blocks in education and personalized learning opportunities, we can keep political ideologies out of the classroom. Schools should be environments for learning, not indoctrination. As state superintendent, I will support parental rights while allowing our teachers to focus on teaching their students. That is how I have run my schools and will lead the OPI. \n\n"},{"question":"The Montana Office of Public Instruction has undergone significant changes during the eight years of Superintendent Elsie Arntzen's tenure. In your opinion, how has Arntzen's leadership changed the agency for good and for ill?","answer":"As state superintendent, I will closely work with colleagues in the Legislature, executive branch, and university system to implement new education laws successfully. Montana students are best served when state agencies work together. I can bring leaders together to expand educational opportunities. I have worked with education committees, the Regents, and executive branch agencies. Montana passed innovative education laws in the last session. As state superintendent, I will faithfully execute the laws of our state and ensure that there are no roadblocks to families accessing the personalized educational opportunities they deserve.\n"}]},"primaryResults":{"race":"superintendent","raceDisplayName":"Superintendent of Public Instruction","party":"R","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"SUSIE HEDALEN","party":"R","votes":98539,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":0.6234357008186868},{"candidate":"SHARYL ALLEN","party":"R","votes":59519,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.3765642991813132}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:48 PM"}},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
