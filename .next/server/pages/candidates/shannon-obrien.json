{"pageProps":{"pageData":{"slug":"shannon-obrien","displayName":"Shannon O'Brien","lastName":"O'Brien","summaryLine":"State senator","summaryNarrative":"O’Brien, 55 as of Election Day, has served in several roles in Montana’s education system for over a decade, including as a parent and a state lawmaker. She was an education policy advisor to former Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock and oversaw the two-year campus at Missoula College as dean from 2015 to 2017. During the past two sessions of the Montana Legislature, she has also worked on education policy as a Democrat representing Missoula’s Senate District 46.\n\nO’Brien grew up in the Pacific Northwest and moved to Montana 16 years ago, where she says she has long-standing family roots in the Gallatin and Missoula valleys.\n\nAs she campaigns, she cites her experience as a former social studies teacher and mother to a Missoula high school student. She also says she said she’s worked across the aisle in the Legislature on issues impacting kindergarten readiness, student safety and the state’s ongoing teacher shortage.\n\n“I am ‘all-in’ on Montana public education and look forward to being the state leader our school’s deserve,” O’Brien said.\n\nThis biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by O’Brien’s campaign via a written questionnaire as well as prior MTFP reporting.\n","party":"D","isIncumbent":false,"status":"active","fecId":null,"campaignWebsite":"https://www.montanansforshannon.com/","campaignFB":"https://facebook.com/montanansforshannon","campaignTW":"https://twitter.com/Shannon4Montana","campaignIG":"https://instagram.com/montanansforshannon","campaignYT":"https://youtube.com/@montanansforshannon","campaignTT":null,"raceSlug":"superintendent","raceDisplayName":"Superintendent of Public Instruction","opponents":[{"slug":"susie-hedalen","displayName":"Susie Hedalen","summaryLine":"Townsend School District superintendent","party":"R"},{"slug":"shannon-obrien","displayName":"Shannon O'Brien","summaryLine":"State senator","party":"D"}],"coverage":[],"finance":null,"questionnaire":{"hasResponses":true,"responses":[{"question":"What do you regard as the most pressing issue facing Montana’s education system?","answer":"The most pressing issue facing our public schools is adequate funding. The state funding formula has not been adjusted for years and consequently school districts are faced with increased costs and fewer resources. Teacher shortages due to low starting salaries, the lack of school counselors and nurses to help keep our students safe and the overwhelming needs for building maintenance and new technology have been neglected due to lack of resources.\n\n"},{"question":"Do you believe changes to Montana’s school finance system are necessary to ensure locally administered school districts have the funding they need to meet their constitutional obligation to provide students with a quality education? What if any changes would you advocate for over the next four years as state superintendent?","answer":"The state’s school funding formula has not been updated in years and consequently schools are not getting the adequate resources they need to operate. Over the last 11 years, I have built relationships with key stakeholders in statewide education including legislators on both sides of the aisle as well as school leaders. I will work with the Montana Legislature in meeting their obligation to update the formula as required by law and as mandated by our state constitution. In addition, the 3% inflationary cap has to be increased to keep pace with the inflation rate today. \n\nMy other priorities include early childhood education, recruitment and retention of teachers, helping districts meet their building and technology needs and returning the Office of Public Instruction to a respected agency that is responsive to school administrators, teachers and parents.\n\n"},{"question":"Education policies have become increasingly politicized in recent years. How can state policy help Montana’s public schools balance the diverse ideologies and worldviews of the families they serve?","answer":"First, partisan politics don’t belong in our public schools or at the Office of Public Instruction. The role of the state superintendent is to advocate on behalf of the students, educators and families in the state Legislature, the governor’s office, the Board of Public Education, and among school communities. The state superintendent must work with the Legislature and bring clarity to how policy will impact learning at the local level. It is paramount that instruction, services and resource distribution meets the diverse needs of our students with the goal that ALL students are able to learn and thrive.\n\n"},{"question":"The Montana Office of Public Instruction has undergone significant changes during the eight years of Superintendent Elsie Arntzen's tenure. In your opinion, how has Arntzen's leadership changed the agency for good and for ill?","answer":"I am running for state superintendent because I know we can do better. The first order of business after being elected will be to request an independent audit of the financial and programmatic situation at OPI in order to identify major gaps and shortfalls. Rebuilding OPI’s reputation and getting the agency back on track will take hard work and focus. The complaint I hear repeatedly from school districts is that OPI is not being responsive. Not answering the phone and not providing guidance to schools is not unacceptable. Under my leadership, the OPI will be responsive and laser focused on supporting schools. Working with educators, community leaders, business owners and universities over the last 12 years, I know Montana has an abundance of talent that can be tapped to rebuild OPI. I’m ready to take on this challenge and will work tirelessly to build a culture of service and restore the pride we once all had in that office.\n"}]},"primaryResults":{"race":"superintendent","raceDisplayName":"Superintendent of Public Instruction","party":"D","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"SHANNON OBRIEN","party":"D","votes":93575,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":1}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:48 PM"}},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
