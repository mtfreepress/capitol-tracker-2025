do you regard as the biggest issue Montana is facing that Congress is in a position to address? How would you address it if elected or re-elected?","answer":"The biggest issue facing the Eastern District is also my top priority — passing a family-friendly Farm Bill that works for families which should include Country of Origin Labeling (COOL), right to repair, and fully fund safety net and conservation programs. We are an agricultural state and this district is driven by agriculture. It’s our number one industry, generating over $7 billion in activity last year, and the heartbeat of our rural communities and cities. However, under 6% of Congress works in agriculture, and even fewer work their land. Electing candidates who like to cosplay but don’t understand it and sure as heck haven’t delivered anything meaningful isn’t the answer. Rosendale voted against investments in critical irrigation projects that are essential. That’s not being a representative, that’s self-serving. Sen. Tester needs a partner in the House who understands agriculture and who will work in a bipartisan way to get things done for farmers and ranchers who feed the world.\n\n"},{"question":"Can you name a current member of Congress you admire? What do respect about them?","answer":"Sen. Tester. He is one of the few other farmers who understand agriculture in Congress. Tester has delivered for Montana, particularly for agriculture and veterans, regardless of who is in charge. From pushing back and blocking dangerous Paraguay beef imports that hurt Montana ranchers by Biden and passing dozens of bills under Trump to delivering critical investments to rebuild infrastructure and irrigation projects, lowering prescription drug prices, protecting veterans and passing the PACT Act, and expanding broadband, Tester has delivered for us and is honest and someone we can trust. I’ll work cooperatively to deliver results for the Eastern District. I’m not alone in knowing that Rep. Rosendale delivered zilch for working folks and agriculture. We get the same if we don’t make a change. Let’s take Montana back by sending another strong leader for rural Montana and agriculture to Congress.\n\n"},{"question":"If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a congressman?","answer":"Yes, if elected to Congress my top priority will be to work for and actually represent folks in the district by doing what's right for them, not special interests, greedy corporations, nor billionaires. I would work cooperatively with any administration to deliver results for farmers and ranchers and Eastern Montana. And I'll stand up to anyone who isn't doing right for rural Montana and America. They also better be ready to clean up the corruption and get back to representing workers and the middle class. \n\n"},{"question":"Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?","answer":"Yes, if elected to Congress my top priority will be to work for and actually represent folks in the district by doing what's right for them, not special interests, greedy corporations, nor billionaires. I would work cooperatively with any administration to deliver results for farmers and ranchers and Eastern Montana. And I'll stand up to anyone who isn't doing right for rural Montana and America. They also better be ready to clean up the corruption and get back to representing workers and the middle class. \n\n"},{"question":"Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?","answer":"The debt increased by a record amount under Trump. Don’t be lied to by my opponents. They only want to steal your Social Security and give it to the Wall Street freeloaders. Solutions are on the table to collect from tax cheats and end giveaways to greedy corporations and billionaires but self-serving politicians work for them. Follow the money and muck the halls. The largest contribution to the historic debt was tax cuts for the rich and Wall Street. The richest nearly doubled their wealth while working people lost nearly as much. First, stop stealing from my pocket and neighbors’ pockets only to give it away to the ultra-wealthy. Second, let the tax cuts that only benefit the rich expire. Third, if billionaires and mega corporations benefit from the financial protections this country provides, pay your darn taxes. It’s unpatriotic to take advantage of our economic and financial system and not give back so we can reinvest in our country, the Americans who built it, and the future.\n\n"},{"question":"Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortion access or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?","answer":"I support freedom, privacy and a woman’s right to choose. Keep creepy politicians out of our doctor’s offices. \n\n"},{"question":"What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?","answer":"Affording a decent place to live has become impossible for too many. Montana leads the nation with workers who can no longer afford basic necessities, like covering rent and health care. It wasn’t always that way and doesn’t have to be this way now. People want a fair shake and a hand up, not a handout. Provide tax credits and financial assistance for new construction and renovation, and rental assistance for those who cannot afford to buy a home right now. Congress should crack down on the speculators and monied land grabbers driving prices up by buying up land, farms, ranches and real estate. The only way we can solve our affordability problems facing the middle class and workers is by mucking the halls of this corruption. It starts with a ban on insider stock trading. We aren’t going to get things back on track if we don’t make a change and elect officials who are committed to cleaning up the corruption, not buying a seat to enrich themselves. I’ll work for you in Congress.\n\n"},{"question":"To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?","answer":"Climate change is real. We’ve already warmed an average of two degrees. That impacts our snowpack and water supplies —  essential for both agriculture and the outdoors, our economic engines. Worse, recurring drought, hail, and weather-related disasters for agriculture are becoming too common. This summer's forecast isn’t looking much better. My daughter is one of my heroes for standing up in defending our right to a clean and healthful environment in the Held v Montana youth climate lawsuit they won. After all those kids stood up for our rights and future, we must do our part and that means taking action. I’m running for Congress to carry our values of freedom, clean air and water, open and public lands, the outdoors, family farms and ranchers, and way of life forward. A good first step will be for the Farm Bill to fully fund conservation and climate resilience programs for family farmers and ranchers. Clean energy can unplug us from big utilities and provide energy freedom for all.\n\n"},{"question":"What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?","answer":"The failure to pass the bipartisan border protection bill, introduced by a Republican, which would have addressed this crisis, for purely political reasons pissed me off so much I filed to run for this seat. We have a bill to protect our border, but self-serving politicians are blocking it in a desperate attempt to score points. Politics at its worst. That’s not good for Montana or America. I’ll do what's right for Montana and America every time because those are my values. Border security and immigration are two issues. I’ll never stop working to protect our borders, but unless your relatives were here before the Mayflower, we were all immigrants at some point. We’re darn lucky our families came here. I support pathways to citizenship, part of the American dream, and develop programs to bolster workforce opportunities to address worker shortages. We also need to address the root causes forcing people to uproot and leave their homes —  political unrest, corruption, violence, crime.\n\n"},{"question":"The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?","answer":"I’d take it right to the pharmaceutical and health care corporations. We have the highest prices for prescriptions in the world. Taxpayers subsidize much of the development. That ain’t right. It’s price-gouging and Congress needs to do more to stop it by expanding our ability to negotiate for lower prescription prices to benefit all Montanans and Americans. Seniors, veterans, and others in need shouldn’t have to head to Canada for affordable life-saving medications. I would also look for ways to expand options and requirements for states to provide Medicaid to those who don’t receive health care through their employer. Gov. Gianforte just shamelessly kicked over 120,000 Montanans, including children, off of health care. Many have jobs but simply can’t afford other options. It’s not only cruel, but it's just bad business. It hurts employers whose employees lost coverage and, as we know, it will raise health care costs for everyone else — another tax — leading to rural provider closures.\n"}]},"primaryResults":{"race":"us-house-2","raceDisplayName":"U.S. House District 2 (East)","party":"D","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"JOHN B DRISCOLL","party":"D","votes":13317,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":0.3331165420116567},{"candidate":"STEVE HELD","party":"D","votes":10583,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.2647272181504365},{"candidate":"MING CABRERA","party":"D","votes":8341,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.2086449708582435},{"candidate":"KEVIN HAMM","party":"D","votes":7736,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.1935112689796633}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:48 PM"}},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
