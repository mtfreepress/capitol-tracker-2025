do you regard as the biggest issue Montana is facing that Congress is in a position to address? How would you address it if elected or re-elected?","answer":"The critically over-budget Sentinel Nuclear Missile project should not be approved in the next Congress.\n\n"},{"question":"Can you name a current member of Congress you admire? What do respect about them?","answer":"I admire Texas Republican Tony Gonzales because he has courage and seems earnest about dealing with immigration and border problems.\n\n"},{"question":"If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a congressman?","answer":"I would quietly encourage him to step back from support of Israel until the right wing government is gone. I’d gladly work with his administration on nuclear arms control.\n\n"},{"question":"Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?","answer":"I would quietly encourage him to support the defense of Ukraine, until a peace with Russia, acceptable to Ukraine has been achieved. I’d gladly work with his administration on nuclear arms control.\n\n"},{"question":"Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?","answer":"Yes. We need to reject any tax cuts, including renewal of the big 2017 tax cut for the wealthy, reject arms deliveries to Israel’s right wing government, and reject the proposed $150 billion Nuclear Missile Modernization package, which includes $20 billion to the U.S. Department of Energy for 1,250 new Nuclear arheads for the modernized Sentinel.\n\n"},{"question":"Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortion access or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?","answer":"I will vote to approve a federal statute reinstating the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe versus Wade.\n\n"},{"question":"What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?","answer":"I will try to make federal land close to our communities available for long-term lease at favorable terms to Limited Equity Housing Cooperatives to build sky-scraping carbon-sequestering multi-family structures. Co-operative members with proprietary leases for a dwelling in such structures will be able to enjoy a gain in equity, limited by the increase in the community’s median income for the corresponding period. The Federal Housing and Urban Development program for guaranteeing 90 percent of required long term financing of the multifamily structures will have to be made as robust as is required.\n\n"},{"question":"To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?","answer":"After threats to our constitutional democracy, the greatest threat our country faces is climate change. Converting from fossil fired electricity, combined with sequestering carbon under ground and in our built environment have to become a way of life, aided by federal incentives.\n\n"},{"question":"What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?","answer":"In addition to working with Rep. Gonzales, I’d visit with former smokejumpers I know who have worked as human being trackers and border patrol pilots. We have to begin with ground truths and the Constitution to fashion a comprehensive, humane  and orderly immigration and naturalization process for addressing human migration. \n\n"},{"question":"The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?","answer":"Increase Indian Health Service Funding fivefold and help restore Medicaid and Extended Medicaid to Montanans.\n"}]},"primaryResults":{"race":"us-house-2","raceDisplayName":"U.S. House District 2 (East)","party":"D","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"JOHN B DRISCOLL","party":"D","votes":13317,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":0.3331165420116567},{"candidate":"STEVE HELD","party":"D","votes":10583,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.2647272181504365},{"candidate":"MING CABRERA","party":"D","votes":8341,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.2086449708582435},{"candidate":"KEVIN HAMM","party":"D","votes":7736,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.1935112689796633}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:48 PM"}},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
