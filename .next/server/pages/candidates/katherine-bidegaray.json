I approach each case with an open mind, basing decisions on the facts and applicable legal principles presented, rather than on personal beliefs or external pressures.”\n\nShe warned that the rights guaranteed in the Montana Constitution — privacy, a clean and healthful environment and so on — are under threat, making it crucial to have “justices with the integrity, fortitude, and commitment to uphold our Constitution, to protect and defend our Montana values and rights, and to keep the judiciary fair and impartial.”\n\nThis biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by Bidegaray as well as prior MTFP reporting.\n","party":"NP","isIncumbent":false,"status":"active","fecId":null,"campaignWebsite":null,"campaignFB":null,"campaignTW":null,"campaignIG":null,"campaignYT":null,"campaignTT":null,"raceSlug":"supco-3","raceDisplayName":"State Supreme Court (Seat 3)","opponents":[{"slug":"katherine-bidegaray","displayName":"Katherine Bidegaray","summaryLine":"State district court judge","party":"NP"},{"slug":"dan-wilson","displayName":"Dan Wilson","summaryLine":"State district court judge","party":"NP"}],"coverage":[{"title":"The race to replace Supreme Court Justice Dirk Sandefur","date":"2024-03-15T15:53:09","link":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/03/15/the-race-to-replace-supreme-court-justice-dirk-sandefur/","tags":["2024 election Guide","Cory Swanson","dan wilson","Dirk Sandefur","Jerry O'Neil","Katherine Bidegaray","Mike McGrath","Montana Supreme Court"],"categories":["2024 Elections"],"featuredImage":"https://montanafreepress.org/2023/02/16/bill-would-shrink-montana-supreme-court-from-seven-justices-to-five/untitled-design-307/","author":"Arren Kimbel-Sannit"}],"finance":null,"questionnaire":{"hasResponses":true,"responses":[{"question":"Briefly describe the legal philosophy you would bring to the bench. As you see it, what is the difference between a good Supreme Court justice and a bad one?","answer":"My legal philosophy centers on fairness, respect and impartiality. It is rooted in a firm commitment to the rule of law. I approach each case with an open mind, basing decisions on the facts and applicable legal principles presented, rather than on personal beliefs or external pressures. I adhere strictly to the 1972 Montana Constitution, the U.S. Constitution, and established legal precedents and statutes. My long-standing practice is to administer justice fairly, efficiently and without prejudice, promoting both community and economic stability. A good justice understands that the judiciary is a co-equal branch of government that primarily functions as an appellate court, reviewing district court cases on appeal and applications for writs and ensuring that court decisions are fair and constitutional. Additionally, a good justice recognizes the role of the judiciary in keeping the other two branches of government in check. A bad justice fails to grasp these fundamental principals.\n\n"},{"question":"What do you regard as the stakes for who is elected to the Montana Supreme Court this election, both for everyday Montanans and for the Montana Constitution?","answer":"The stakes are high because our 1972 Montana Constitution and many of the unique rights it protects — privacy, education, and the preservation of Montana’s pristine landscapes — are facing significant threats. The Montana Supreme Court's decisions profoundly impact everyday Montanans every day, making it crucial to have justices with the integrity, fortitude, and commitment to uphold our Constitution, to protect and defend our Montana values and rights, and to keep the judiciary fair and impartial. With 38 years of combined legal and judicial experience, I am fully prepared to meet that commitment.\n\n"},{"question":"How can the state Supreme Court, as the only nominally nonpartisan branch of state government, maintain its independence and avoid politicization?","answer":"The Montana Supreme Court can maintain its independence by ensuring its justices remain impartial and nonpartisan, not swayed by political groups or partisan activities. It is essential for justices to avoid even the appearance of partisanship to maintain public trust and the integrity of our judicial system.\n"}]},"primaryResults":{"race":"supco-3","raceDisplayName":"State Supreme Court (Seat 3)","party":"NP","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"KATHERINE BIDEGARAY","party":"NP","votes":126041,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":0.4869493660127184},{"candidate":"DAN WILSON","party":"NP","votes":89314,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.3450575263292098},{"candidate":"JERRY ONEIL","party":"NP","votes":43483,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.16799310765807185}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:48 PM"}},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
