{"pageProps":{"pageData":{"slug":"james-brown","displayName":"James Brown","lastName":"Brown","summaryLine":"Public Service Commission president","summaryNarrative":"Brown is the outgoing president of the Montana Public Service Commission, the state’s elected utility board. Brown, 53 as of Election Day, is a graduate of Beaverhead County High School who served as a congressional aide in Washington, D.C. and ran a private legal practice prior to his election to the PSC. \n\n“My Montana roots, my extensive educational training, and my 30-plus years of work experience have prepared me to be a highly effective state auditor from day one,” Brown told MTFP. “I have an extensive background in protecting Montanans from insurance and securities fraud while regulating those who work in these important industries fairly and impartially.”\n\nBrown said he knows “what it means to sign both the front and back of a check” as a small business owner and would work to ensure “robust competition” and a “healthy regulatory environment” for Montana’s insurance industry if elected auditor.\n\nBrown is in the last year of his first four-year PSC term. He also made an unsuccessful run for the Montana Supreme Court in 2022. \n\nThis biography is based on Brown’s response to MTFP’s questionnaire and past media coverage.\n","party":"R","isIncumbent":false,"status":"active","fecId":null,"campaignWebsite":"https://www.jamesbrownformontana.com/","campaignFB":"https://www.facebook.com/JamesBrownMontana/","campaignTW":null,"campaignIG":null,"campaignYT":null,"campaignTT":null,"raceSlug":"state-auditor","raceDisplayName":"State Auditor","opponents":[{"slug":"james-brown","displayName":"James Brown","summaryLine":"Public Service Commission president","party":"R"},{"slug":"john-repke","displayName":"John Repke","summaryLine":"Retired business executive","party":"D"}],"coverage":[{"title":"Brown wins GOP primary race for Montana state auditor","date":"2024-06-05T10:45:13","link":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/06/05/brown-wins-gop-primary-race-for-montana-state-auditor/","tags":["2024 Election","2024 election Guide","James Brown"],"categories":["2024 Elections"],"featuredImage":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/01/19/psc-president-james-brown-announces-run-for-montana-state-auditor/untitled-design-626/","author":"Amanda Eggert"},{"title":"Current utility board commissioner and insurance salesman square off in GOP primary for state auditor","date":"2024-05-22T15:35:05","link":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/05/22/current-utility-board-commissioner-and-insurance-salesman-square-off-in-gop-primary-for-state-auditor/","tags":["2024 election Guide","2024 elections","Commissioner of Insurance and Securities","James Brown","John Jay Willoughby","Matt Rosendale","State Auditor","Troy Downing"],"categories":["2024 Elections"],"featuredImage":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/05/22/current-utility-board-commissioner-and-insurance-salesman-square-off-in-gop-primary-for-state-auditor/untitled-design-78-2/","author":"Amanda Eggert"},{"title":"PSC President James Brown announces campaign for state auditor","date":"2024-01-19T13:22:34","link":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/01/19/psc-president-james-brown-announces-run-for-montana-state-auditor/","tags":["2024 election Guide","2024 elections","James Brown","State Auditor"],"categories":["2024 Elections"],"featuredImage":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/01/19/psc-president-james-brown-announces-run-for-montana-state-auditor/untitled-design-626/","author":"Arren Kimbel-Sannit"}],"finance":null,"questionnaire":{"hasResponses":true,"responses":[{"question":"What issues within the state auditor’s purview would you prioritize if elected?","answer":"The role of the state auditor is far reaching and multi-faceted. Consequently, it is hard to name just one important issue to address. But I absolutely will focus on key issues such as making Montana a place where people seeking insurance coverage have numerous policy choices and can find insurance at affordable rates due to a healthy regulatory environment and robust competition. \n\nI will also focus on protecting all Montanans from insurance fraud and scams. The underhanded criminals who perpetrate crimes against our seniors and other white-collar criminals will know that there is no place for them to operate in the Treasure State.\n\n"},{"question":"Montanans in some areas are reporting difficulty finding affordable home and property insurance as some companies pull out of markets located within the wildland-urban interface. What, if anything, should the state auditor do to help homeowners in this position?","answer":"The best way to protect against insurance companies leaving the state is by creating a regulatory environment that makes Montana attractive to do business in. Additionally, incentives could be offered to property or homeowners who undertake their own mitigation efforts. Insurance agents can also be a tremendous asset in this regard because they are on the most local level and will be most accessible to the consumer.\n\n"},{"question":"The state auditor position has often been a springboard for higher office. If elected, will you commit to serving out your full four-year term rather than making a bid for another position in 2026?","answer":"If I am elected as state auditor, yes, I intend to serve my full term.\n"}]},"primaryResults":{"race":"state-auditor","raceDisplayName":"State Auditor","party":"R","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"JAMES BROWN","party":"R","votes":113284,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":0.6958262952612021},{"candidate":"JOHN JAY WILLOUGHBY","party":"R","votes":49521,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.30417370473879796}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:48 PM"}},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
