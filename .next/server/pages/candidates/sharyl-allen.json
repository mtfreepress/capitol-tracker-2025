{"pageProps":{"pageData":{"slug":"sharyl-allen","displayName":"Sharyl Allen","lastName":"Allen","summaryLine":"Former Harrison Public School principal/superintendent","summaryNarrative":"Allen, 65 as of Election Day, has spent the past four decades working at various levels of public education, most recently as the principal and superintendent at Harrison Public School in Madison County. Prior to that role, Allen served as deputy state superintendent under Elsie Arntzen, routinely representing the Office of Public Instruction in education policy discussions at the Legislature and before the Board of Public Education. Allen left the agency in July 2023.\n\nAllen was born in Choteau and raised in Fairfield. She got her start in school administration in the Augusta Public Schools, and from there went on to jobs at multiple other districts in Montana and Arizona. During her time at OPI, Allen says she led efforts to establish new approaches to teacher retention and student assessment and worked with state lawmakers, higher education leaders and local public school administrators on a range of other initiatives. She has emphasized student safety and parental rights as core issues in her campaign.\n\n“We are in a battle for the hearts and minds of our kids,” Allen said, “and we need someone at the OPI that will fight for a bright future for each one of our kids while getting false philosophies out of what our kids experience.”\n\nThis biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by Allen’s campaign via a written questionnaire as well as prior MTFP reporting.\n","party":"R","isIncumbent":false,"status":"lost-primary","fecId":null,"campaignWebsite":null,"campaignFB":null,"campaignTW":null,"campaignIG":null,"campaignYT":null,"campaignTT":null,"raceSlug":"superintendent","raceDisplayName":"Superintendent of Public Instruction","opponents":[{"slug":"susie-hedalen","displayName":"Susie Hedalen","summaryLine":"Townsend School District superintendent","party":"R"},{"slug":"shannon-obrien","displayName":"Shannon O'Brien","summaryLine":"State senator","party":"D"}],"coverage":[{"title":"What state superintendent candidates are saying about school funding","date":"2024-05-23T16:54:11","link":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/05/23/what-montana-state-superintendent-candidates-saying-about-school-funding/","tags":["2024 election Guide","Shannon O’Brien","Sharyl Allen","Susie Hedalen"],"categories":["2024 Elections"],"featuredImage":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/05/23/what-montana-state-superintendent-candidates-saying-about-school-funding/spi/","author":"Eric Dietrich"},{"title":"Lining up to lead OPI","date":"2023-07-28T16:26:52","link":"https://montanafreepress.org/2023/07/28/candidates-line-up-to-lead-montana-office-public-instruction/","tags":["2024 election Guide","Austin Knudsen","Elsie Arntzen","Greg Gianforte","Office of Public Instruction","Shannon O’Brien","Sharyl Allen","Susie Hedalen"],"categories":["2024 Elections"],"featuredImage":"https://montanafreepress.org/2022/07/21/montana-teacher-license-revenue-redirect/untitled-design-122/","author":"Alex Sakariassen"}],"finance":null,"questionnaire":{"hasResponses":true,"responses":[{"question":"What do you regard as the most pressing issue facing Montana’s education system?","answer":"Winning the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of our kids.\n\n"},{"question":"Do you believe changes to Montana’s school finance system are necessary to ensure locally administered school districts have the funding they need to meet their constitutional obligation to provide students with a quality education? What if any changes would you advocate for over the next four years as state superintendent?","answer":"Yes - I would advocate for. simplified and transparent system that ensures equity and elements that address the critical needs of rural Montana districts differently than our larger systems. The second thing I would advocate for is a change to the inflation methods for public schools. Lastly, I would advocate for marijuana dollars for public schools that is guaranteed, not like the lottery for schools that waned. \n\n"},{"question":"Education policies have become increasingly politicized in recent years. How can state policy help Montana’s public schools balance the diverse ideologies and worldviews of the families they serve?","answer":"1. State policy needs to reflect that values that Montana stands for rather than the ideologies of foreign entities or those striving to rewrite the history of our nation and state.\n2. We all share the same air on this planet and building understanding and appreciation for different cultures and upbringing can be done through expanded exchange programs of teachers and students. As a Rotarian, I was able to send two teachers to India who came back with a strong message: Appreciate public education in America.\n3. Worldviews should be honored in context but never at the expanse of the land where they live: Our views need to see the blessings that come from being an American in the land of the free, home of the brave and one nation under God.\n\n"},{"question":"The Montana Office of Public Instruction has undergone significant changes during the eight years of Superintendent Elsie Arntzen's tenure. In your opinion, how has Arntzen's leadership changed the agency for good and for ill?","answer":"As the longest tenured deputy during her 8 years (3.5), there were seasons of peace and progress.  Here are three that stand out. \n\n1. The Digital Communications team, early in the tenure was on fire and a tremendous asset in capturing and telling educational stories across the state.  This work was great.\n2. Telework implementation during COVID was a reflection of good as it tied strongly to the changing workforce and priorities. \n3. The focus on the family right-sized the lens of the OPI to remember the power and importance of parents. \n\nChallenges: \n1. The OPI staff turnover, and the loss of staff history - due to lack of systems to ensure systems worked on processes rather than people. \n2. The waning relationship with the Board of Public Education \n3. The elimination of monthly representation at MASS meetings - left the impression that the OPI was not so interested in the work of our school leaders or supporting their work.\n"}]},"primaryResults":{"race":"superintendent","raceDisplayName":"Superintendent of Public Instruction","party":"R","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"SUSIE HEDALEN","party":"R","votes":98539,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":0.6234357008186868},{"candidate":"SHARYL ALLEN","party":"R","votes":59519,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.3765642991813132}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:48 PM"}},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
