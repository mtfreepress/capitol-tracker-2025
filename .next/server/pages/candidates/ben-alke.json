The attorney general needs to spend more time fighting crime and less time on politics.”\n\nAlke, who began his legal career clerking for then-Montana Supreme Court Justice Brian Morris and later worked with prominent liberal constitutional attorney Jim Goetz, now is a partner specializing in commercial litigation at Crist, Krogh, Alke & Nord. \n\nDespite being a Democrat, Alke says he’d work with every legislator to defend laws they pass in court regardless of their party.\n\n“I am not a career politician, an activist or an extremist,” he said. “I am a highly qualified, experienced attorney who wants to serve the best interests of all Montanans and get things done.”\n\nThis biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by Alke’s campaign and previous MTFP reporting.\n","party":"D","isIncumbent":false,"status":"active","fecId":null,"campaignWebsite":"https://www.alkeformt.com/","campaignFB":"https://www.facebook.com/benalkeformontana","campaignTW":"https://twitter.com/Alke4MontanaAG","campaignIG":"https://www.instagram.com/alkeformontana/","campaignYT":null,"campaignTT":null,"raceSlug":"attorney-general","raceDisplayName":"Attorney General","opponents":[{"slug":"austin-knudsen","displayName":"Austin Knudsen","summaryLine":"Incumbent attorney general","party":"R"},{"slug":"ben-alke","displayName":"Ben Alke","summaryLine":"Bozeman attorney","party":"D"}],"coverage":[{"title":"Bozeman attorney Ben Alke launches campaign for state attorney general ","date":"2023-10-02T13:31:46","link":"https://montanafreepress.org/2023/10/02/bozeman-attorney-ben-alke-launches-campaign-montana-attorney-general/","tags":["2024 election Guide","2024 elections","ben alke"],"categories":["2024 Elections"],"featuredImage":"https://montanafreepress.org/img_7874/","author":"Arren Kimbel-Sannit"},{"title":"Ethics office accuses attorney general of violating professional conduct rules","date":"2023-09-05T22:00:36","link":"https://montanafreepress.org/2023/09/05/montana-ag-austin-knudsen-accused-of-violating-rules-of-professional-conduct/","tags":["2024 election Guide","Austin Knudsen","ben alke","Jim Rice","Kris Hansen","Mike McGrath","Montana Supreme Court","Office of Disciplinary Counsel","timothy strauch"],"categories":["News"],"featuredImage":"https://montanafreepress.org/screenshot-2023-08-02-at-1-13-14-pm/","author":"Arren Kimbel-Sannit"}],"finance":null,"questionnaire":{"hasResponses":true,"responses":[{"question":"The attorney general is Montana’s chief law enforcement officer. What do you see as the state’s top law enforcement issue?","answer":"Crime is up in Montana, primarily because of the drug crisis. Meth and fentanyl are doing terrible things to our communities.\n\nAs crime increases, Montana Department of Justice needs to provide more support to local prosecutors and law enforcement. The attorney general must also coordinate with federal and tribal law enforcement officers to combat drug traffickers.\n\nWhat we are doing today is not good enough. The State is not stepping up to provide help where it is needed most. For example, Lake County does not have the resources to prosecute felonies on the Flathead Reservation and there are around 2,000 outstanding warrants. The attorney general needs to spend more time fighting crime and less time on politics. \n\n\n"},{"question":"Montana attorneys general have historically worked with attorneys general from other states to advance multi-state litigation against parties such as federal officials, pharmaceutical companies and social media companies. What if any national issues would you focus the Montana Department of Justice’s litigation resources on?","answer":"I want to focus on what is happening inside Montana rather than national issues. My job is to represent the people of the state of Montana, not any national interests, and that is what I intend to do. \n\nThe instances when the Montana attorney general should participate in a national lawsuit are limited. The tobacco litigation and opioid cases are good examples — the attorney general had to participate in those cases to recover funds. If a similar case arises, then I will participate.\n\nHowever, the Montana Department of Justice’s litigation resources will be focused on our state. We have a drug crisis, human trafficking is on the rise, and bad actors are engaging in unfair trade practices inside Montana that target senior citizens and consumers. Those issues need to be addressed first. \n\n"},{"question":"The attorney general has the job of defending against lawsuits that challenge the constitutionality of laws passed by the state Legislature, which leaders from both major parties say will likely remain in Republican control following this year’s election cycle. How do you see yourself working with legislators as elements of the agenda they pass face judicial review?","answer":"As attorney general of the state of Montana, my job will be to set aside politics and make decisions based on the facts and the law. Regardless of their political party, I will work with every Montana state legislator in good faith and in accordance with the Montana Constitution. I am not a career politician, an activist or an extremist. I am a highly-qualified, experienced attorney who wants to serve the best interests of all Montanans and get things done.\n"}]},"primaryResults":{"race":"attorney-general","raceDisplayName":"Attorney General","party":"D","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"BEN ALKE","party":"D","votes":92599,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":1}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:48 PM"}},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
