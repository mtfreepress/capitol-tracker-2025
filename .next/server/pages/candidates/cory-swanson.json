It undermines the reliability of the law, and I felt I could do better.”\n\nThis biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by Swanson as well as prior MTFP reporting.\n","party":"NP","isIncumbent":false,"status":"active","fecId":null,"campaignWebsite":null,"campaignFB":null,"campaignTW":null,"campaignIG":null,"campaignYT":null,"campaignTT":null,"raceSlug":"supco-chief-justice","raceDisplayName":"State Supreme Court (Chief Justice)","opponents":[{"slug":"jerry-lynch","displayName":"Jerry Lynch","summaryLine":"Former federal magistrate judge","party":"NP"},{"slug":"cory-swanson","displayName":"Cory Swanson","summaryLine":"Broadwater County attorney","party":"NP"}],"coverage":[{"title":"The race to replace Supreme Court Justice Dirk Sandefur","date":"2024-03-15T15:53:09","link":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/03/15/the-race-to-replace-supreme-court-justice-dirk-sandefur/","tags":["2024 election Guide","Cory Swanson","dan wilson","Dirk Sandefur","Jerry O'Neil","Katherine Bidegaray","Mike McGrath","Montana Supreme Court"],"categories":["2024 Elections"],"featuredImage":"https://montanafreepress.org/2023/02/16/bill-would-shrink-montana-supreme-court-from-seven-justices-to-five/untitled-design-307/","author":"Arren Kimbel-Sannit"},{"title":"The politics and philosophy behind the race for chief justice of the Montana Supreme Court ","date":"2023-12-14T12:00:21","link":"https://montanafreepress.org/2023/12/14/the-politics-and-philosophy-behind-the-race-for-chief-justice-of-the-montana-supreme-court/","tags":["2024 election Guide","2024 elections","Cory Swanson","Doug Marshall","Jerry Lynch","Montana Supreme Court"],"categories":["2024 Elections"],"featuredImage":"https://montanafreepress.org/2023/02/16/bill-would-shrink-montana-supreme-court-from-seven-justices-to-five/untitled-design-307/","author":"Arren Kimbel-Sannit"},{"title":"Broadwater County Attorney announces candidacy for Montana Supreme Court ","date":"2023-12-01T16:28:11","link":"https://montanafreepress.org/2023/12/01/broadwater-county-attorney-announces-candidacy-for-montana-supreme-court/","tags":["2024 election Guide","2024 elections","Cory Swanson","Jerry Lynch","Montana Supreme Court"],"categories":["2024 Elections"],"featuredImage":"https://montanafreepress.org/2021/03/26/a-court-divided-house-bill-325-supreme-cout-election-by-district/montana-supreme-court-entrance_1200x675/","author":"Arren Kimbel-Sannit"}],"finance":null,"questionnaire":{"hasResponses":true,"responses":[{"question":"Briefly describe the legal philosophy you would bring to the bench. As you see it, what is the difference between a good Supreme Court justice and a bad one?","answer":"Justices must strive to uphold the rule of law by providing the very best legal interpretation possible to resolve the legal question in each case before us, and also to build a body of case law that others may rely upon. To do so, I would interpret every legal document as a textualist, according to the philosophy of judicial restraint. That means resolve the case before you, not the next five cases you can imagine. That means following precedent unless there is a compelling reason to depart from it, not modifying precedent as it suits you to reach preferred outcomes.\n\nA good Supreme Court justice should work hard and learn every day. He or she should follow the law to the case's conclusion. He or she should respect the power of the office by not abusing it or disrespecting the litigants. Finally, a good justice should build a professional atmosphere of honest debate and collective learning, not anger or score-settling. A bad justice lets personality get in the way of duty.\n\n"},{"question":"What do you regard as the stakes for who is elected to the Montana Supreme Court this election, both for everyday Montanans and for the Montana Constitution?","answer":"There are two open seats on the Montana Supreme Court this year, which means the court will change significantly, no matter who wins. The chief justice race features two philosophical contrasts.\n\nIf I win, I will try to make the court less about the personality of each Justice, and more about cultivating the wisdom and experience of each member to produce our best legal interpretation. It is not the court's job to actively fight for or against any party or case. It is the court's job to render unbiased and accurate legal opinions that deliver justice to the people. Focus on the law, not the politics.\n\nThe chief justice also advocates for the budget and resources for the entire judicial branch. With my background and commitment to judicial process, I will effectively defend the judiciary in the budget and policy arenas, not perpetuate ill-conceived inter-branch feuds. People are counting on timely and accurate court outcomes, and I will fight for the resources to deliver them.\n\n"},{"question":"How can the state Supreme Court, as the only nominally nonpartisan branch of state government, maintain its independence and avoid politicization?","answer":"To modify a phrase from Chief Justice John Roberts, the quickest way to remove politics from case decisions is to stop deciding cases on the basis of politics.\n\nThe Supreme Court should focus on good old-fashioned appellate judging, no matter the case before it. But some cases are inherently political, so what to do? Just focus on good old-fashioned appellate judging. Follow the rules of interpretation like you would for any case. Let the law lead to the outcome, don't decide the outcome and then modify the law or overturn precedent to get there. That is fundamental to the problem and the solution.\n\nIf the judiciary simply does its job in this manner, then political cases will be just like every other case: the loser will be upset, but the reasoning will be clear and unassailable. The Supreme Court should uphold the rule of law by removing political concerns from its legal interpretations. Let the law be clear, and let the political chips fall where they may.\n"}]},"primaryResults":{"race":"supco-chief-justice","raceDisplayName":"State Supreme Court (Chief Justice)","party":"NP","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"CORY SWANSON","party":"NP","votes":120041,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":0.46206224932061557},{"candidate":"JEREMIAH LYNCH","party":"NP","votes":97732,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.3761903662132305},{"candidate":"DOUG  MARSHALL","party":"NP","votes":42021,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.16174738446615394}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:48 PM"}},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
