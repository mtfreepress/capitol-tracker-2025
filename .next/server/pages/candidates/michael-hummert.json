{"pageProps":{"pageData":{"slug":"michael-hummert","displayName":"Michael Hummert","lastName":"Hummert","summaryLine":"U.S. Navy veteran","summaryNarrative":"Hummert, 65, is a U.S. Navy veteran and Helena resident who cites Bill Clinton’s 1996 State of the Union Speech as the best summary of his political perspective. He also cites a hardscrabble childhood and diverse work experience including stints as a salvage diver, school bus driver, Montana Highway patrolman and running a home remodeling business.\n\nHe describes himself as a pragmatic Democrat who wouldn’t be afraid to buck his party and isn’t “afraid to ask the hard questions.”\n\nHummert said he grew up in southern Illinois and moved to Helena in 1996 after retiring from the Navy.\n\n“Our county’s leadership is consumed by their self-interest, party loyalty, and we have no one to represent the people,” he told MTFP, “that is my mission.”\n\nThis biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by Hummert’s campaign via interviews and a written questionnaire.\n","party":"D","isIncumbent":false,"status":"lost-primary","fecId":null,"campaignWebsite":null,"campaignFB":null,"campaignTW":null,"campaignIG":null,"campaignYT":null,"campaignTT":null,"raceSlug":"us-senate","raceDisplayName":"U.S. Senate","opponents":[{"slug":"jon-tester","displayName":"Jon Tester","summaryLine":"Incumbent U.S. senator","party":"D"},{"slug":"tim-sheehy","displayName":"Tim Sheehy","summaryLine":"Bozeman businessman","party":"R"},{"slug":"sid-daoud","displayName":"Sid Daoud","summaryLine":"Kalispell city councilman","party":"L"},{"slug":"robert-barb","displayName":"Robert Barb","summaryLine":"Billings resident","party":"G"}],"coverage":[],"finance":[{"displayName":"Jon Tester","party":"D","candidateCommitteeName":"MONTANANS FOR TESTER","candidateId":"S6MT00162","totalReceipts":43775556.22,"totalDisbursments":33373881.22,"cashOnHand":10882248.87,"coverageEndDate":"2024-06-30","isThisCandidate":false,"candidateStatus":"active"},{"displayName":"Tim Sheehy","party":"R","candidateCommitteeName":"TIM SHEEHY FOR MONTANA","candidateId":"S4MT00183","totalReceipts":14065647.85,"totalDisbursments":10795081.65,"cashOnHand":3270566.2,"coverageEndDate":"2024-06-30","isThisCandidate":false,"candidateStatus":"active"},{"displayName":"Brad Johnson","party":"R","candidateCommitteeName":"BRAD FOR MONTANA","candidateId":"S2MT00062","totalReceipts":43094,"totalDisbursments":43094,"cashOnHand":0,"coverageEndDate":"2024-06-30","isThisCandidate":false,"candidateStatus":"lost-primary"},{"displayName":"Charles Walkingchild","party":"R","candidateCommitteeName":"CHARLES WALKINGCHILD","candidateId":"S4MT00209","totalReceipts":0,"totalDisbursments":0,"cashOnHand":0,"coverageEndDate":null,"isThisCandidate":false,"candidateStatus":"lost-primary"}],"questionnaire":{"hasResponses":true,"responses":[{"question":"What do you see as the biggest issue Montana is facing that the Senate is in a position to address? How would you address it if elected or re-elected?","answer":"It is the same problem that plagues the entire country. Crony capitalism, corruption in government to include Congress and people in power throughout our government that never seem to be held accountable. Much of this can be corrected with a balance budget amendment similar to the one that Jon Tester voted against in 2011. Our country holds the position of being in control of the reserve currency of the world. Our leadership has debased our currency by borrowing $35 trillion. This must stop. It is at the core of the corruption. It is also at the core of inflation, the most insidious tax on poor people. We must insist on a balanced budget amendment, restrict any person over the age of 74 from serving in the Federal government, and term limits of 12 years in Congress. We need voting laws that are beyond reproach. We need a federal clearing house for candidates so the voter can be well informed, and the candidates held responsible for what they say.\n"},{"question":"If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a senator?","answer":"I believed Joe Biden when he said in 2020, He would only run for one term of office. I believed Joe Biden when he said Kamala Harris was qualified to be president if anything was to happen to him. The problem with old people is they forget what they tell people, and they are the last to know when it's time to quit. Just like George W. Bush said no more nation building when he was running for office, that didn't work out for the people. Our Senate is evenly split, giving each senator a unique position of power. The Senate confirms the presidents appointments to cabinet positions. I will not confirm any cabinet officer that will not answer direct questions with direct answers. The same for federal judges. I am not partisan, my only loyalty is to the people, and the country. I am of the opinion that Joe Biden is past his prime and that he should step aside and let Kamala Harris become president. He said she was qualified. This is the time to find out, we the people need to know.\n"},{"question":"Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?","answer":"In many ways Donald Trump provides evidence of his narcissism just like Joe Biden does. His ability to make cabinet appointments is also suspect. Ryan Zinke was no better prepared for interior secretary than the tiny little electrical company in his hometown that he was trying to hire to rebuild Puerto Rico's electrical grid. The president must work with Congress. Congress does not seek his approval, but he must seek our approval. The more independent a senator is from his party, the greater the influence he will have on the process. Jon Tester operates in lockstep with the Democrat leadership and that is why he has been ineffectual after 18 years. He refused to work with Donald Trump, nothing’s changed. There are things I can work on with Trump. Such as the southern border and immigration control. Maybe we can get our balanced budget amendment. We must move our country forward.\n"},{"question":"Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?","answer":"Please do not mischaracterize these statements. They are a starting point for negotiation on very important issues. Social Security and Medicare are currently not part of the deficit. They do need reform, they will be insolvent in less than nine years. We currently borrow approximately half of what we spend each year. Everything must be visited. We must stop lying to our people so they can rise to the occasion and understand the problems our current leadership has put us in. I support both, spending cuts and tax increases. It will take bold honest discussions and debates open to the public to resolve this issue. Either way there are dark days ahead of us. This will be our moment as a nation to come together and like our founding fathers we must make changes now to guide our country into the future and protect the Republic. A key component of this will be returning sovereignty and responsibility to the states. Sacrifices will be required, it is unthinkable not to succeed.\n"},{"question":"Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortions or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?","answer":"There have been many opportunities since 1973 for both parties to fix this problem. Neither one of them wanted to lose abortion as a wedge issue to drive us apart. While the Supreme Court provided pro choice with the opportunity to compromise with pro life and craft a piece of legislation both could live with, it was wasted. Now pro life is in the driver seat and it is unlikely they will craft a bill to compromise with pro choice. My starting point on the issue would be no state should restrict a woman's right to have an abortion in the first trimester. Rape and incest carve out. If two doctors are willing to sign off on an unviable pregnancy up to the sixth month, it should be granted. This should be a baseline and beyond this each state should have complete control of the abortion issue. It is unlikely the federal government will ever get involved with abortion based on past performance. It is now a states’ rights issue. It will remain so until the Supreme Court takes it up again.\n"},{"question":"What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?","answer":"The federal government should not get involved in affordable housing. Affordable housing is a regional problem. Best solved by the states. The federal government is in debt over $34 trillion. The federal government does not have money to spend on another issue. I was listening to the California Senate debate. Rep. Barbara Lee stated that if she won the Senate seat she would get $100 billion of funding for much-needed housing in California. Now you know why we are $34 trillion in debt. What Congress can do to affect the housing crisis is simply to balance the budget. This would drive inflation down and stabilize the cost of interest to purchase a home. Everything is interlinked. We have a housing shortage, yet we leave our southern border open and invite 9 million people into our country. We could drive the cost of building a house down if we harvested more timber instead of letting it burn.\n"},{"question":"To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?","answer":"Climate change is real, but it will most likely not be the cause of our extinction. Congress has not gotten anything right in the last 80 years, so why would you think they know what they're talking about this time. Keeling is responsible for the first carbon dioxide measurements of the atmosphere in 1958. It measured 313 ppm and is currently at 414 ppm. That's only 25% increase of our current carbon dioxide level in 66 years. I suspect the reason they are using this as the bogeyman to try and scare us is simply because Congress doesn't blame any one particular industry beyond transportation for the problem. Transportation uses only 15% of the total petroleum products. Pollution is the bigger problem that Congress does not want to address. Instead Congress has assisted our corporations in shipping the pollution overseas. There are over 1 million abandoned oil wells spewing methane that is 28 times more toxic to the environment than carbon dioxide. This is a threat to our environment.\n"},{"question":"What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?","answer":"This has been a problem for my entire life. We must seal the southern border completely. We need to re-examine all of our refugee and immigration programs. Immigration is a three to one loss for the federal government and state agencies. We simply do not have the money to support an immigrant population. It's not about compassion it's about common sense. We the people of this country have a culture. It has eroded due to bad policies of our federal government. Our government needs to stop sanctioning countries in an effort to destroy their economies. This does not make our people safer it just makes our politicians more powerful and dangerous. This is behavior that must be corrected in our state department. Middle East condition since 9/11 2001 are a prime example. Only a fool or politician would say it's a safer place. We have destroyed entire nations with our intervention. We must bring all of our military home to protect our boarders and the American people.\n"},{"question":"The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?","answer":"In 2000 a family of four's health care was about $6500 per year, 2010 affordable health care act was passed. At that time insurance was approximately $12,500. In 2020 it had increased by over $10,000 a year. That certainly does not seem very affordable to me. We still have tens of millions uninsured. A document, 1,000s of pages controlling our health care, Congress and Jon Tester did not read it. When Trump was president Tester could've revisited the problem, but he just voted no on repealing it. The medical industry reports record profits at the expense of the people. I cannot think of one thing that Congress has managed well. For this reason single-payer scares the hell out of me. If we are to balance our budget and move our country forward then everything must be examined. I do not have the answer for this one, yet. One thing is for sure, we must get it right this time. Other countries have models that we can explore, we do not have to reinvent the wheel.\n"},{"question":"Under what if any circumstances do you believe the U.S. should be providing military support to parties involved in foreign conflicts?","answer":"We should allow our military industrial complex to sell arms to countries in order to protect their borders. It should be controlled by Congress. The keyword is sell, not provide them with the money to purchase. If we are to save our country from economic chaos and therefore the world from economic chaos. We must stop the policy of interfering in other countries issues. There have been more people killed in the past 60 years because of our intervention. It is a contributor to our $34 trillion debt. We should revisit every treaty we are involved in. Some will stand and some will need to be renegotiated. We need a strong navy, a well-trained expeditionary force, and a domestic force designed for the defense of our nation. We must harden our space and cyber defense. Once our debt has been paid off in full we can revisit helping other countries. We have a responsibility to our country to provide peace and tranquility within our borders.\n"}]},"primaryResults":{"race":"us-senate","raceDisplayName":"U.S. Senate","party":"D","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"JON TESTER","party":"D","votes":103347,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":0.9698752780202146},{"candidate":"MICHAEL HUMMERT","party":"D","votes":3210,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.030124721979785468}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:48 PM"}},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
