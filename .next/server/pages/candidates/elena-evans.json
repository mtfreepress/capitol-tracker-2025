She argues that members of the PSC are failing to treat the commission work as a  full-time job.\n\n“It’s disappointing that folks who get a really decent salary to fulfill this job aren’t necessarily participating to the fullest extent,” said Evans, who earned a master’s degree in geology from the University of Montana.\n\nIn addition to criticizing the commission’s vote on the rate hike, Evans has accused the sitting commissioners of opposing “commonsense, cost-saving measures” and harboring an “anti-technology sentiment.” Evans argues that the current commission’s approach hinders economic development in Montana by driving up energy bills for residential customers and companies, which often in turn pass on those increases to consumers.\n\nThis biography is based on an MTFP interview with Evans and information from her campaign website.\n","party":"I","isIncumbent":false,"status":"active","fecId":null,"campaignWebsite":null,"campaignFB":null,"campaignTW":null,"campaignIG":null,"campaignYT":null,"campaignTT":null,"raceSlug":"psc-4","raceDisplayName":"Public Service Commission (Seat 4)","opponents":[{"slug":"jennifer-fielder","displayName":"Jennifer Fielder","summaryLine":"Incumbent public service commissioner","party":"R"},{"slug":"elena-evans","displayName":"Elena Evans","summaryLine":"Missoula County environmental health manager","party":"I"}],"coverage":[{"title":"Independent candidate Elena Evans cleared to run for PSC","date":"2024-06-28T12:07:12","link":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/06/28/independent-candidate-qualifies-for-public-service-commission-race-in-montana/","tags":["2024 election Guide","Elena Evans","Montana Public Service Commission"],"categories":["State Government"],"featuredImage":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/06/28/independent-candidate-qualifies-for-public-service-commission-race-in-montana/evans_pulp_1/","author":"Amanda Eggert"}],"finance":null,"questionnaire":{"hasResponses":true,"responses":[{"question":"Regulatory matters under the PSC’s jurisdiction are often highly specialized and complex. Please describe your qualifications for performing the technical aspects of the commission's work.","answer":"Most importantly, I know how to build a budget and stick to it — and I alway read the fine print. \n\nI earned undergraduate and master’s degrees in Geology. I’ve also completed Incident Command System and household hazardous waste operator training and received my Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response certification. My coursework, certifications and experience demonstrate my ability to understand complex systems, interpret rules and regulations, and understand how small details will impact real people. \n\nWhile at the Montana Association of Conservation Districts, I managed budgets, organizational documents, legal compliance, lobbying, and staff supervision. In each of these areas, I solved complex problems and worked hard to make government regulations understandable and manageable for conservation districts across the state.\n"},{"question":"To what extent do you regard climate change as an issue that needs to be addressed by the PSC? What if any actions regarding climate change do you think it’s appropriate for the PSC to consider?","answer":"The PSC is supposed to require utilities to identify how they will respond and continue to serve customers in the face of unprecedented wildfire, cold snaps, storms, and drought. Instead of asking hard questions in planning documents, the current PSC rubber stamps decisions that have big impacts on consumers and businesses. Why was Colstrip down during the cold snap? What are we doing to adequately prepare for wildfire? What factors go into Public Safety Power shutoffs? How are we preparing our hydropower resources for drought?  What improvements will result from the big storm that left people in Missoula and Mineral Counties without power for days? The first step in planning for the future is holding utilities accountable to their current plans.\n\nIt’s important to be sure to make decisions with the appropriate data and in the decision-making space provided by statute and the constitution. It’s also important to use the authority of the PSC to its fullest extent in order to achieve the mission.\n"},{"question":"Montana’s energy grid is facing a major transition as coal plants are taken offline. How should the PSC manage customer affordability and grid reliability as that transition takes place?","answer":"Above all, the PSC needs to listen to Montanans and make decisions in a transparent manner as they tackle these challenges. Utilities need to plan for the future and discuss their expenses in planning documents openly and honestly. As changes become more complex, it will be even more important for planning to be transparent and for the PSC to make utilities respond to feedback from customers and business owners who provide comments on the long range plan.\n\nThere are opportunities (new transmission lines, reconductoring, etc.) that the PSC needs to push utilities to consider. The PSC should be looking at these opportunities and bigger markets to identify how companies can grow in a way that drives down cost for consumers and takes advantage of our skilled workforce. The recent storm in Missoula and Mineral counties shows how fragile our energy grid is. It’s an opportune time to think about tools and technology, like batteries and mini-grids, that could be implemented over time to provide more stability.\n"},{"question":"What if any specific actions should be taken by the PSC to reduce Montana consumers’ power bills?","answer":"We need to be sure that no community is left behind when it comes to innovation, cost-savings and jobs. Montana Electric Co-ops are pursuing an array of creative solutions and it should be evaluated if these ideas can be scaled to the larger grid. Our workforce and business community is primed to take advantage of markets and opportunities, but we need to ensure that we do so in a fair, forward-looking way.\n\nRecently, Northwestern Energy submitted documents for a rate case that was missing essential information. Why would a huge company think it was appropriate to submit an application that doesn’t meet the standards? Because the PSC has allowed them to do it before. Let’s get people on the PSC who want to do the job and represent the people.\n"},{"question":"What other issues within the PSC’s domain would you prioritize as a commissioner? What specific actions would you encourage regarding those issues?","answer":"Three years ago, a routine legislative audit revealed that Public Service Commissioners were spending tax dollars on flight upgrades and expensive computer gear. The audit proved that some commissioners even falsified documents so they wouldn’t get caught wasting our money. A Republican State Senator called the behavior “despicable.” This year, a new audit revealed more problems, including high staff turnover, and suggested that commissioners needed a code of conduct to ensure good behavior.\n\nIn short, the current PSC is a mess, and taxpayers deserve better. As a lifelong public servant, I’ve always stressed professional conduct, honesty, and transparency. If elected, I will hold other commissioners to the same standard. I would work to implement the recommendations of auditors and respect the concerns of staff members.\n\nThe PSC mission is to ensure an affordable, reliable, and sustainable power supply to utility customers, and there is no room for unprofessional conduct as we pursue that goal.\n"}]},"primaryResults":{"race":"psc-4","raceDisplayName":"Public Service Commission (Seat 4)","party":"I","resultsTotal":null}},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
