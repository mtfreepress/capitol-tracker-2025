Transparency and sunshine are fundamental goods in every branch of government.”\n\nHe’s also a Republican official who has previously served as executive director of the state GOP. He says that experience makes him an asset to the conservative cause — the clerk, unlike the justiceships on the Supreme Court itself, is a partisan position, and Greenwood says that’s a good thing. When Republican state officials or their attorneys come before the Supreme Court, Greenwood is “right at their side” helping them prepare, he said.\n\n“The clerk of the Montana Supreme Court is a partisan office, and thank God. In a Montana Supreme Court where extremist, progressive ideologues rule the day, Republicans must preserve every advantage we can get,” he told MTFP. “I am the only Republican anywhere near that court. We cannot risk losing the gains we've made.”\n\nThis biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by Greenwood as well as prior MTFP reporting.\n","party":"R","isIncumbent":true,"status":"active","fecId":null,"campaignWebsite":null,"campaignFB":null,"campaignTW":null,"campaignIG":null,"campaignYT":null,"campaignTT":null,"raceSlug":"clerk-of-court","raceDisplayName":"Clerk of the State Supreme Court","opponents":[{"slug":"bowen-greenwood","displayName":"Bowen Greenwood","summaryLine":"Incumbent Montana Supreme Court clerk","party":"R"},{"slug":"erin-farris-olsen","displayName":"Erin Farris-Olsen","summaryLine":"Helena attorney","party":"D"},{"slug":"roger-roots","displayName":"Roger Roots","summaryLine":"Libertarian attorney","party":"L"}],"coverage":[{"title":"The race to be the partisan clerk of Montana’s nonpartisan Supreme Court","date":"2024-05-13T11:47:01","link":"https://montanafreepress.org/2024/05/13/the-race-to-be-the-partisan-clerk-of-montanas-nonpartisan-supreme-court/","tags":["2024 election Guide","Bowen Greenwood","erin farris-olsen","Jason Ellsworth","jordan ophus","Roger Roots"],"categories":["2024 Elections"],"featuredImage":"https://montanafreepress.org/2023/02/16/bill-would-shrink-montana-supreme-court-from-seven-justices-to-five/untitled-design-307/","author":"Arren Kimbel-Sannit"}],"finance":null,"questionnaire":{"hasResponses":true,"responses":[{"question":"What are your objectives for the role of clerk of the Montana Supreme Court?","answer":"As clerk, I fight every day to advance conservative values at the court.

The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
