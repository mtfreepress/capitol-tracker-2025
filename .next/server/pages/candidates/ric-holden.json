do you regard as the biggest issue Montana is facing that Congress is in a position to address? How would you address it if elected or re-elected?","answer":"There is not one specific issue troubling eastern Montana but a kaleidoscope of several issues. It is my observation that the border crisis, agriculture, natural resource development, inflation and home purchase prices share a top priority type of interest with Montana voters. One thing is for sure: In every corner of the district the open border policy of the Democrats seems to irritate people the most. There are thousands of people streaming illegally across the border daily. We are giving these illegal aliens all sorts of free benefits, like free debit cards, cell phones, health care, education and hotel accommodations. Don’t forget that they also get a free ride to their favorite sanctuary city for even more benefits. The border needs to be closed first and then we can negotiate a new immigration policy. Those who have already illegally crossed the border need to be sent back. We cannot afford to take in all these people on the backs of the American taxpayer.\n\n"},{"question":"Can you name a current member of Congress you admire? What do respect about them?","answer":"I admire Sen. Ted Cruz. I have always thought that he tried to uphold the virtues of the U.S. Constitution. He does not seem to let his distractors get him down and always stays on point.\n\n"},{"question":"If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a congressman?","answer":"Let's hope that does not happen. He is totally out of it mentally. At any rate, I respect the position and if he wins, he will certainly deserve my respect as our president. Once the election is over it is time to get to work for the American citizens that elected us. All of our efforts should be focused on America and not so much with bickering between all the members.\n\n"},{"question":"Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?","answer":"I do support former President Trump for president. I am willing to listen to his ideas and give him support to get his time-tested policies passage. I never imagined that he would be able to get so much done as he did the first four years. Inflation was low, interest rates were low, the jobs report always showed good results and the farm bills were always supported by President Trump. I never would have believed that a man from New York City could help and support Montana farmers to the degree that he did. I will give him all the support he needs to get the southern border crisis under control.\n\n"},{"question":"Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?","answer":"We have about a $35 trillion U.S. debt to service. Congress needs to take the steps now to bring down the debt level. We are broke by any business standards. The U.S. government takes in about $5 trillion a year in tax revenue. At this point the best way to start getting a handle on our spending habits is to stop increasing our spending. No new programs. We can't even afford what we have already committed to in the past. We sure could cut national public radio, endowment for the arts, free cell phones, debit cards, hotel rooms, health care and education to illegal aliens. I don't get any of that stuff free myself, why should an illegal alien get it?\n\n"},{"question":"Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortion access or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?","answer":"I have always been endorsed by the Right to Life organization. I will continue to support the efforts to save babies from being killed. In this case the U.S. Supreme Court has spoken, and they say it is a state right issue. So let the states handle it and we should step back and see how it goes for a few years.\n\n"},{"question":"What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?","answer":"Congress can work to support the development of our natural resources industry, which will in turn stimulate the economy with new job growth and consumption of American products. We need to drill and use our own American oil to fuel our economy. Once we begin rebuilding our energy sector then the economy will get much better and the value of our dollar will regain strength and purchasing power. This is how you lift everyone up in a modern economy. A strong economy makes everything more affordable.\n\n"},{"question":"To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?","answer":"I don't view climate change as an urgent issue. There is no amount of tax dollars you can spend to stop the climate from changing if in fact it is changing. Science now shows that when Al Gore declared that the East Coast was going to be flooded by 2020, it in fact did not happen. The shoreline is exactly where it has always been as confirmed by satellite photos. Pollution that is manmade is something that we can control. Let's make more of an effort to tackle an issue like that and the complications that our city landfills are facing.\n\n"},{"question":"What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?","answer":"To me there is a simple answer. Shut the border down from illegal alien crossings, build the wall, stop paying out all the freebies and send the non-profits home. Gather up as many of these people that illegally crossed the border that we can find and ship them back to where they entered the US. What the Democrats have allowed to happen is a crime against all of us taxpayers and our children that will be paying for this debacle for the rest of their adult lives.\n\n"},{"question":"The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?","answer":"I never supported Obamacare. The day that bill passed was the day my health insurance premiums began to increase uncontrollably. I was told by the Democrats that I would be able to keep using my doctor and my premiums were not going to increase. They were clearly wrong. My bill from Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield rose from $450 per month to $1,700 just before I canceled the plan. I ended up getting coverage from a unfunded Christian health care cost share policy. It is working and now I understand that the Democrats do not like Christian health care companies. Let's repeal Obamacare and let the free market go out and price the product in a competitive atmosphere.\n"}]},"primaryResults":{"race":"us-house-2","raceDisplayName":"U.S. House District 2 (East)","party":"R","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"TROY DOWNING","party":"R","votes":36050,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":0.36150135876377565},{"candidate":"DENNY REHBERG","party":"R","votes":17070,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.17117415240215397},{"candidate":"STACY ZINN","party":"R","votes":13478,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.13515437762602409},{"candidate":"ELSIE ARNTZEN","party":"R","votes":9394,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.09420093659436639},{"candidate":"KEN BOGNER","party":"R","votes":8969,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.08993913139396127},{"candidate":"RIC HOLDEN","party":"R","votes":7063,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.07082618854226207},{"candidate":"JOEL G.

The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
