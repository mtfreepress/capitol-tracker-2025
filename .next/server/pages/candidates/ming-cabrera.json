do you regard as the biggest issue Montana is facing that Congress is in a position to address? How would you address it if elected or re-elected?","answer":"AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE\nI strongly support policies that prioritize both affordability and excellence in Montana’s health care system. The worrying closure of nursing homes, rural hospitals and the lack of mental health care access to essential services in underserved areas and to expand Medicare prescription drug coverage right now. These actions are essential to alleviate financial burdens on our elderly and at-risk populations, and on the taxpayers who are footing the bill for expensive and preventable services.\n\nFurthermore, it is important that we untie the hand of health care providers and finally empower them to make diagnostic decisions with the best interest of their patients, instead of asking them to spend their precious time negotiating with bureaucrats who hold the purse strings. Upholding these principles requires concrete policy initiative at improving access, affordability and quality of care statewide.\n\n"},{"question":"Can you name a current member of Congress you admire? What do respect about them?","answer":"Even though he is not a current member of Congress I admire Montana's Mike Mansfield. He was the Senate majority leader who was able work across the aisle with members of the Republican Party. He came from humble beginnings as a worker in the Butte mines to being admired and respected to lead Congress through some very difficult times. He was a quiet leader and left our state legislation with laws and regulations to protect our environment but also an era of economic growth for Montana. \n\n"},{"question":"If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a congressman?","answer":"I will continue to support the work of President Biden with the bipartisan bill Infrastructure Reduction Act to build the necessary programs of Montana with internet needs of the cities and towns of Montana. I will support the passing of the Farm Bill 2025 and push for more reforms in prescription drug coverage and for improved amendments to Medicare. I plan to work to improve the lives of the people of Montana and to listen and vote those on venues which continues to improve the safety our nations well-being.\n\n"},{"question":"Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?","answer":"I will continue to focus on the issues not the attitudes. His administration has many programs President Trump is very passionate about such as immigration and border policies. I will be able vote on the feasibility of these projects and make sure outcomes and goals are possible. If he is president I will respect his stature as president and work across the aisle for the welfare of our nation and Montana.\n\n"},{"question":"Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?","answer":"We need to make sure everyone pays there fair share. The ability of corporate taxes and owners have been able to find tax loopholes that have made the federal deficit a problem.\n\nI recognize the federal deficit continues to grow and the overspending need to stop. Since the Congress is the beginning of the budget I will continually make sure those programs on the docket are reasonable and not part of a pork barrel favoring. \n\n"},{"question":"Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortion access or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?","answer":"As a degree holder in biology with years of experience in the medical field, my stance on reproductive rights is shaped by both academic and professional knowledge and compassionate humanity. Working in a hospital in the Philippines, I witnessed the  consequences of restrictive abortion laws, where women faced life-threatening situations and the loss of both maternal and fetal lives. \n\nIt is not the government’s role to pry into our private medical records or to make moral decisions about women’s health care. I firmly believe that women are perfectly capable of making these deeply personal decisions for themselves, and as a candidate for public office, I am committed to opposing legislation that would limit a woman’s right to choose and actively supporting measures that codify this fundamental right once and for all. Everyone deserves the autonomy to make decisions about our own bodies, and it is my pledge to stand firm in ensuring that this right is protected and upheld.\n\n"},{"question":"What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?","answer":"Montana, like many parts of our nation, is facing a housing affordability crisis, leaving far too many families struggling to find safe and affordable housing. This crisis is not only impacting individuals and families but also our communities and economy. Here are some potential approaches that I believe could make a real difference. We need Congress to address investing in housing initiatives, promoting homeownership opportunities, limiting corporate ownership of residential property, addressing zoning and regulatory barriers and supporting sustainable housing solutions. \n\n"},{"question":"To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?","answer":"As a man with the privilege of experience both in the oil fields of Eastern Montana and the lecture halls of medical school, I have developed a strong preference for no-nonsense, scientific, evidence-based decision making. I am committed to preserving our planet for future generations. I advocate for investment in renewable energy to ensure Montana remains at the forefront of innovation. I support incentivizing lower emissions and promoting environmentally friendly practices to reduce our carbon footprint.\n\nI recognize the significance of support to communities reliant on fossil fuels, whose labor has contributed to Montana’s economic strength and made discussions about a clean, sustainable future financially feasible. It is essential to balance environmental conservation with the well-being of communities impacted by these policies, striving for solutions benefiting all parties while addressing the challenges of climate change. \n\n"},{"question":"What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?","answer":"A short-term solution to secure the border is to hire more patrols, increase the amount of immigration judges, and improve the gateway areas at border crossings.\n\nFor some long term solutions to the border is to work with the Organization of American States to use their data in countries to screen immigrants that seek asylum. We need to look at the nations with the most people coming to the border as San Salvador, Venezuela and Cuba and find economic ways to improve their hardships in their nations and try to seek economic help in improving some of the catastrophes they are facing. Also, countries as Cuba or Venezuela, begin to negotiate in lifting embargos for trade. Another avenue to improve with our South American nations is to find amendments in the USMCA trade agreement for a more robust economic venue between Mexico, Canada and the United States. With these types of programs many of those who are leaving their countries may begin to find prosperity without traveling. \n\n"},{"question":"The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?","answer":"I would support lowering the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 50 to extend health care coverage to a larger portion of the population. The success of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has shown the need. Extending Medicare coverage to individuals aged 50 and above would ensure that more people have access to comprehensive health care services, including preventive care, treatment for chronic conditions, and financial protection from health care costs.\n\nI would support enabling Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices. Also, I support  addressing high provider prices in health care. Monopolistic practices can limit competition, drive up costs and reduce patient choice. Streamlining administrative paperwork would not only alleviate the burden on health care providers but also allow them to focus more on patient care and less on administration. By tackling integration, high prescription prices, and administrative inefficiencies, we can make real progress toward a more equitable system.\n"}]},"primaryResults":{"race":"us-house-2","raceDisplayName":"U.S. House District 2 (East)","party":"D","resultsTotal":[{"candidate":"JOHN B DRISCOLL","party":"D","votes":13317,"isWinner":true,"votePercent":0.3331165420116567},{"candidate":"STEVE HELD","party":"D","votes":10583,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.2647272181504365},{"candidate":"MING CABRERA","party":"D","votes":8341,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.2086449708582435},{"candidate":"KEVIN HAMM","party":"D","votes":7736,"isWinner":false,"votePercent":0.1935112689796633}],"reportingTime":"6/10/2024 12:53:48 PM"}},"votingFAQ":"### When are Montana’s 2024 elections?\n\nVoters picked party nominees for the November general election in the June 4 primary. The November General Election that will decide the ultimate winner in each race is set for Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\n### Who runs Montana’s elections?\n\nMontana elections are administered at the county level. The process is overseen by county clerks and election administrators, who help to train and monitor the volunteer election judges that staff the polls. Ballots are typically processed and counted at central county locations, with the results reported to the Montana secretary of state’s office via a statewide software system called ElectMT.\n\nOnce polls close, the secretary of state’s office provides results through its website. The state-level office also provides guidance to local election administrators to ensure compliance with state election laws. Additionally, enforcing compliance with some laws governing political campaigns, particularly those involving campaign finance, falls to a separate office known as the Commissioner of Political Practices.\n\n### Do I need to be registered in order to vote?\n\nYes. If you’re unsure about your registration status, you can check it through the [Montana secretary of state's My Voter Page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/).\nYou can register to vote by stopping by your county election office any time during regular business hours to pick up an application. After you’ve filled it out, you’ll need to get it back to your county election office by mail or in person (the latter option is strongly recommended close to Election Day to ensure your application is received in time). If you do present your application in person, you’ll have to provide a photo ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you happen to be applying for a Montana driver’s license or identification card before the election, you can register to vote at the same time.\n\n### Can I register to vote on Election Day?\n\nYes. The state Legislature has sought to enact an earlier registration deadline, but under a March 2024 ruling by the Montana Supreme Court, same-day voter registration remains legal in Montana. Residents can register to vote or update their voter registration at their county’s election office prior to 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\n### Does Montana have voter ID requirements?\n\nYes, you will be required to present identification when voting at the polls. However, under the Montana Supreme Court’s March ruling, changes made to those requirements by the 2021 Legislature remain blocked. The current forms of identification voters can use at the polls are a current Montana driver’s license, state-issued photo ID, tribal or military photo ID, a U.S. passport or a student ID. If you don’t have a photo ID, you can use a utility bill, a bank statement, a voter confirmation card or any other government document that shows your name and address.\n\n### Are there situations where I wouldn't be eligible to vote?\n\nAccording to state law, you can't vote if you'll be under age 18 on Election Day, are not a U.S. citizen, or have lived in Montana less than 30 days. Convicted felons who are currently incarcerated in a penal facility and people whom judges have ruled to be of unsound mind are also ineligible to vote. Otherwise, you're good to go.\n\n### Can I vote online?\n\nNo, that’s not an option in Montana.\n\n### Can I vote by mail?\n\nYes, you can sign up as an absentee voter by checking a box on your voter registration form. If you’re already registered to vote, you can fill out a separate form and submit it to your county election office.\n\nIf you’re registered as an absentee voter, a ballot should be mailed to you a few weeks in advance of each election day. You can make sure your address is current via the [My Voter page](https://app.mt.gov/voterinfo/). County election officials are slated to mail ballots to voters for the November 2024 General Election Oct. 11.\n\nYou can return ballots by mail, or drop them off in person at your county’s election office. Either way, the election office must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day in order to count it.\n\n### How do I vote in person?\n\nIf you plan to vote at the polls, just be sure you know where your polling location is and head there between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Election Day. You'll need to provide a photo ID or other accepted form of identification and sign the precinct register, at which point you’ll get your ballot and be directed to a voting booth. If you have any technical questions or run into any problems, the election judges at your polling place should be able to help you.\n\n### I have a friend or family member who isn't able to drop off his or her mail-in ballot. Can I do it for them?\nYes, you can. The Montana Legislature did make some changes to ballot collection laws in 2021 related to paid ballot collection, but those changes have also been blocked by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\n### Who should I vote for?\n\nThat’s your call, not ours. We hope the information we present on this guide is helpful as you make that decision for yourself, though.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
